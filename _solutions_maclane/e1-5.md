description: Defining the exponential in monoids and groups (considered as one object categories)
---

Let $$M$$ be a monoid considered as a category and consider $$\mathbf{B}M = \presheaves{M}$$.
Objects in this category are sets equipped with a *right* action by $$M$$.
Maps $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ are the *equivariant maps* $$X \rightarrow Y$$ with $$f(xm) = f(x)m$$.
When we refer to $$M$$ as an object in $$\mathbf{B}M$$, we mean the set $$M$$ equipped with the trivial right action by $$M$$ from the monoid structure.

We wish to determine the exponent in this category.

**Theorem**:
(a) The exponent $$Y^X$$ in $$\mathbf{B}M$$ is the set $$\Hom(M \times X, Y)$$ itself equipped with the right action $$(km)(n, x) = k(mn, x)$$ for each equivariant map $$k : M \times X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$m \in M$$.


*Proof*:
We define $$(\dash)^X = \Hom(M \times X, \dash)$$ and show that it is right adjoint to $$\dash \times X$$.
We will define the unit and co-unit and show that they satisfy the triangle identities.

First consider the unit $$\eta : 1_{\mathbf{B}M} \rightarrow (\dash \times X)^X$$, having components $$\eta_Y : Y \rightarrow (Y \times X)^X$$.
Let $$\eta_Y$$ assign to each $$y \in Y$$ a map $$M \times X \rightarrow Y \times X$$ by $$\eta_Y(y)(m, x) = (ym, x)$$.
To check that it is natural, consider an arrow $$f : Y \rightarrow Z$$.
The naturality square is:

Take an element $$y$$ in the upper left.
Following it down and right we obtain first the map $$(m, x) \mapsto (ym, x)$$ and then the map $$(m, x) \mapsto (f(ym), x)$$.
Following it right and down, we obtain $$f(y)$$ and then $$(m, x) \mapsto (f(y)m, x)$$.
But of course these two expressions are the same precisely because $$f$$ is equivariant.

Now consider the counit $$\varepsilon : (\dash)^X \times X \rightarrow 1_{\mathbf{B}M}$$ (the evaluation map).
It has components $$\varepsilon_Y : Y^X \times X \rightarrow Y$$.
For each pair $$k : M \times X \rightarrow Y, x \in X$$ let $$\varepsilon_Y(k, x) = k(1_M, x)$$.
The naturality square is:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/maclane/e1-5_1.svg" width="500"/></div>

Starting with a pair $$(k, x)$$ in the upper left, we follow it down and right to obtain first $$k(1_M, x)$$ and then $$f(k(1_M, x))$$.
Following it right and down we obtain first the pair $$(f \circ k, x)$$ and then $$(f \circ k)(1_M, x) = f(k(1_M, x))$$.

Finally, we verify the triangle identities.
First, we want to show the following is the identity:

$$
Y \times X \xrightarrow{\eta_Y \times 1_X} (Y \times X)^X \times X \xrightarrow{\varepsilon_{Y \times X}} Y \times X
$$

Indeed, we have:

$$
(y, x) \mapsto ((m, x) \mapsto (ym, x), x) \mapsto (y 1_M, x) = (y, x)
$$

Next, we need to show that this is the identity:

$$
Y^X \xrightarrow{\eta_{\left(Y^X\right)}} (Y^X \times X)^X \xrightarrow{\varepsilon_Y \circ \dash} Y^X
$$

Starting with a map $$k : M \times X \rightarrow X$$, the first step obtains the map $$(m, x) \mapsto (km, x)$$.
The next step obtains the map $$(m, x) \mapsto (km)(1_M, x)$$.
But by the right action on $$\Hom(M \times X, Y)$$, we have $$(km)(1_M, x) = k(m1_M, x) = k(m, x)$$.
So the final map is just $$k$$.

So the defined unit and counit are natural transformations satisfying the triangle identities, exhibiting an adjunction between $$\dash \times X$$ and $$(\dash)^X$$.

If the monoid is a group, the exponent is a bit "nicer", in that it can be realized as the underlying exponent in $$\mathbf{Set}$$ with an appropriate group action.

**Theorem**:
(b) In the category $$\mathbf{B}G$$ of right $$G$$-sets, the exponent $$Y^X$$ is the set $$\Hom(X, Y)$$ equipped with the action $$(fp)(x) = f(xp^{-1}) p$$ for each equivariant map $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$p \in G$$.


*Proof*:
Groups are, of course, monoids, and so we know that $$Y^X = \Hom(G \times X, Y)$$ with the right-action $$(kp)(q, x) = k(pq, x)$$.
We exhibit an isomorphism between this $$G$$-set and the one in the theorem.
Simply define $$\varphi : \Hom(G \times X, Y) \rightarrow \Hom(X, Y)$$ by $$\varphi(k)(x) = k(1_G, x)$$.
Define $$\phi : \Hom(X, Y) \rightarrow \Hom(G \times X, Y)$$ by $$\phi(f)(q, x) = f(xq^{-1})q$$.
We verify that these are indeed equivariant maps that compose to the identity.

For $$\varphi$$, we need to verify that $$\varphi(kp) = \varphi(k)p$$.
On the left, we have:

$$
\varphi(kp)(x) = (kp)(1_G, x) = k(p 1_G, x) = k(p, x)
$$

On the other side,

$$
\left[ \varphi(k) p \right](x) = \left[ \varphi(k)(xp^{-1}) \right] p = k(1_G, xp^{-1})p = k(1_G p, x p^{-1} p) = k(p, x)
$$

where the penultimate step uses the fact that $$k$$ is an equivariant map.

For $$\phi$$, we must again verify $$\phi(fp) = \phi(f)p$$.
On the left, we have

$$
\phi(fp)(q, x) = \left[ (fp)(xq^{-1}) \right]q = f(xq^{-1}p^{-1})p q = f(xq^{-1}p^{-1}pq) = f(x)
$$

using the fact that $$f$$ is equivariant.
On the right, we have

$$
\left[ \phi(f)p \right](q, x) = \phi(f)(pq, x) = f(x(pq)^{-1})pq = f(x(pq)^{-1}pq) = f(x)
$$

again using equivariance of $$f$$.

Finally, observe that:

$$
\varphi(\phi(f))(x) = \phi(f)(1_G, x) = f(x1_G)1_G^{-1} = f(x)
$$

and

$$
\phi(\varphi(k))(q, x) = \left[ \varphi(k)(xq^{-1}) \right]q = k(1_G, xq^{-1})q = k(1_G q, xq^{-1}q) = k(q, x)
$$

So $$\varphi \circ \phi = \phi \circ \varphi = 1$$, and we have exhibited an isomorphism between the two $$G$$-sets.
