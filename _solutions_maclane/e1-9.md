description: Characterizing the subobject classifier in the category of presheaves on a poset
---

Consider $$\presheaves{\mathbf{P}}$$ where $$\mathbf{P} = (P, \leq)$$ is a poset considered as a category.
We wish to characterize the subobject classifier of $$\presheaves{\mathbf{P}}$$ in this special case.
A subset $$D \subset P$$ is a *downset* if $$a \leq b \in D$$ implies $$a \in D$$.
We use $$\downset p = \setbuilder{x}{x \leq p}$$ to denote the downset generated by $$p$$, and $$\mathcal{D}(S)$$ to denote the set of downsets of $$S \subseteq P$$.
A sieve on $$p \in \mathbf{P}$$ is then precisely an element of $$\mathcal{D}(\downset p)$$.
Thus, the subobject classifier can be defined with $$\Omega(p) = \mathcal{D}(\downset p)$$ and $$\Omega(p \leq q) : \Omega(q) \rightarrow \Omega(p)$$ the map that sends $$D$$ to $$\downset p$$ if $$\downset p \subseteq D$$ or itself otherwise.

The terminal presheaf is still $$\Delta T$$, taking constant value $$\set{T}$$.
The monic $$\true : \Delta T \hookrightarrow \Omega$$ will have components $$\true_p : \set{T} \rightarrow \Omega(p)$$ sending $$T$$ to $$\downset p$$ (the maximal sieve).
Take a monic $$G \hookrightarrow F$$, which we may consider to be an actual subfunctor in the sense that $$G(p) \subseteq F(p)$$ for all $$p$$ and $$G(p \leq q)$$ is a restriction of $$F(p \leq q)$$ for all arrows.
The characteristic function $$\chi : F \rightarrow \Omega$$ has components $$\chi_p : F(p) \rightarrow \Omega(p)$$ with $$\chi_p(\alpha) = \setbuilder{x}{x \leq p \tand F(x \leq p)(\alpha) \in G(x)}$$.

Consider $$\mathbf{Q} = (\mathbb{Q}, \leq)$$ as a category and consider $$\presheaves{\mathbf{Q}}$$.
In this case, a downset of rational numbers corresponds to a one-sided Dedekind cut, thus each corresponds precisely to a real number via its supremum (see [here](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Dedekind+cut#onesided_cuts) for a discussion).
However, we also consider $$\varnothing$$ a downset appearing in every $$\Omega(p)$$; we can represent this as an adjoined value $$-\infty$$.
From this point of view, $$\presheaves{\mathbf{Q}}$$ has a subobject classifer $$\Omega$$ with $$\Omega(p) = \setbuilder{r \in \mathbb{R} \cup \set{-\infty}}{r \leq p}$$.
