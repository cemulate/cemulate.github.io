description: An equivalence of categories preserves a subobject classifier

**Theorem**:
An equivalence of categories preserves a subobject classifier


Let $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$\mathbf{D}$$ be equivalent, with $$\Omega_{\mathbf{C}}$$ a subobject classifier in $$\mathbf{C}$$.
Let $$F : \mathbf{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{D}$$ and $$G : \mathbf{D} \rightarrow \mathbf{C}$$ be the equivalence.
We may choose $$F$$ and $$G$$ to be an *adjoint* equivalence, so that $$F \dashv G$$, and $$\eta : 1 \rightarrow GF$$ and $$\varepsilon : FG \rightarrow 1$$ are natural isomorphisms.

What we wish to show is that $$\text{Sub}_{\mathbf{D}}(\dash) \cong \Hom(\dash, F(\Omega_{\mathbf{C}}))$$ -- this means precisely that $$F(\Omega_{\mathbf{C}})$$ is a subobject classifier in $$\mathbf{D}$$ ($$F(\Omega_{\mathbf{D}})$$ is a representing object for the subobject functor).
But since $$F$$ and $$G$$ are adjoint, the right-hand functor is isomorphic to $$\Hom(G(\dash), \Omega_{\mathbf{C}}) = \text{Sub}_{\mathbf{C}}(G(\dash))$$.
So, it is sufficient to show that $$\text{Sub}_{\mathbf{C}}(G(\dash)) \cong \text{Sub}_{\mathbf{D}}(\dash)$$.

Indeed, we will define a natural transformation $$\alpha : \text{Sub}_{\mathbf{C}}(G(\dash)) \rightarrow \text{Sub}_{\mathbf{D}}(\dash)$$ as $$\alpha_X = \varepsilon_X \circ F(\dash)$$.
Notice that this assigns to an arrow $$i : S \rightarrow G(X)$$ precisely its transpose $$\overline{i}$$ under the adjunction $$F \dashv G$$.
This shows that each $$\alpha_X$$ is an isomorphism (it is precisely the homset bijection of the adjunction), so we need only show that the transformation is natural.
Keeping in mind that $$\text{Sub}$$ operates on arrows "by pullback", we have the naturality diagram for $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/maclane/e1-4_1.svg" width="400"/></div>

Take a subobject $$i : S \xrightarrow{} G(Y)$$ at the top-right.
Following the top left path, we pullback along $$G(f)$$ to obtain $$P \xrightarrow{} G(X)$$, and then take the transpose to get $$F(P) \xrightarrow{} FG(X) \xrightarrow{\sim} X$$.
Following the other direction, we take the transpose to obtain $$F(S) \xrightarrow{} FG(Y) \xrightarrow{\sim} Y$$, and then we must pull this back along $$f$$.
To say that that these are the same amounts to saying that the outer rectangle of this combined diagram is a pullback:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/maclane/e1-4_2.svg" width="350"/></div>

Indeed, the top square is a pullback because it is the image under $$F$$ of a pullback, and viewing $$F$$ as a right adjoint (after inverting the unit and counit) means it preserves limits.
The bottom square can be shown a pullback directly by considering another cone $$X \xleftarrow{p_2} P \xrightarrow{p_1} FG(Y)$$.
Simply define $$\phi = \varepsilon_X^{-1} \circ p_2$$.
We have $$p_2 = \varepsilon_X \circ \phi$$ immediately.
For the top:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \varepsilon_Y \circ p_1 = f \circ p_2 && \text{From the new cone} \\
\Rightarrow \enspace & \varepsilon_Y \circ p_1 = f \circ \varepsilon_X \circ \phi && \text{Substitute for } p_2 \\
\Rightarrow \enspace & \varepsilon_Y \circ p_1 = \varepsilon_Y \circ FG(f) \circ \phi && \text{From the original cone} \\
\Rightarrow \enspace & p_1 = FG(f) \circ \phi
\end{align*}
$$


Uniqueness of $$\phi$$ is immediate from the definition.

The pasting lemma then confirms that the outer rectangle is a pullback, and thus we have shown that the $$\alpha$$ is natural and thus a natural isomorphism, completing the proof.
