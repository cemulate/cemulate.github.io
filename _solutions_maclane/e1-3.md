description: The category of modules over a ring has no subobject classifier
---


**Theorem**:
For any ring $$R$$, $$\modcat{R}$$ has no subobject classifier.


*Proof*:
Assume it did have a subobject classifier $$\Omega$$.
Note that the terminal object in $$\modcat{R}$$ is the zero module, which is also initial, so we have $$1 = 0 = \set{0}$$, and so there is exactly one choice for the map $$\set{0} \xrightarrow{\true} \Omega$$.
Since $$\set{0} \xrightarrow{\true} \Omega$$ is a sub-object classifier, we have for any monic $$M \xrightarrow{i} N$$, a unique classifying map $$N \xrightarrow{\phi} \Omega$$ such that $$i$$ is the pullback of $$\true$$ along $$\phi$$.
But, considering $$\true$$ as the unique map from the initial object, this is precisely the statement that $$M$$ is the kernel of $$\phi$$.
More compactly, this means for *any* submodule $$M$$ of $$N$$, $$M$$ must be the kernel of its classifying map $$\phi$$.
Now consider that the zero module is a subobject of *any* module -- thus, for *any* module $$N$$ there must be a map $$N \rightarrow \Omega$$ that has trivial kernel -- i.e., an injection from $$N$$ into $$\Omega$$.
Then, in particular, this is true for the $$R$$-module $$\prod_{\Omega} \Omega$$ ($$\modcat{R}$$ has all small limits).
But, the underlying set of this module has cardinality $$2^{\abs{\Omega}}$$, a contradiction.
