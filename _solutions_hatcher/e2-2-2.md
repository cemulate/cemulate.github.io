**Theorem**:
If $$f : S^{2n} \rightarrow S^{2n}$$ is a continuous map, then there is an $$x \in S^{2n}$$ with $$f(x) = x$$ or $$f(x) = -x$$.

---

*Proof*:
It suffices to show that at least one of $$f$$ and $$-f$$ must have a fixed point.
If $$f$$ has a fixed point, then clearly it satisifes $$f(x) = x$$.
If $$-f$$ has a fixed point, then it satisfies $$-f(x) = x \Rightarrow f(x) = -x$$.

To that end, suppose towards contradiction that $$f$$ and $$-f$$ both have no fixed points.
Since $$f$$ has no fixed points, we have $$\deg f = (-1)^{2n+1} = -1$$.
At the same time, since $$-f$$ has no fixed points, we have $$\deg(-f) = -1$$ as well, but:

$$
\deg(-f) = \deg (-\id \circ f) = \deg(-\id) \deg(f) = (-1)(-1) = 1
$$

and we have a contradiction.
So at least one of $$f$$ and $$-f$$ must have a fixed point.

**Corollary**:
Every map $$f : \mathbb{R}P^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2n}$$ has a fixed point.

---

*Proof*:
$$S^{2n}$$ is a cover of $$\mathbb{R}P^{2n}$$, and by the lifting lemma $$f$$ lifts to a map $$\wt{f} : \mathbb{R}P^{2n} \rightarrow S^{2n}$$.
If $$\rho : S^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2n}$$ is the canonical cover, then we can lift the whole map $$f$$ to a map $$g = \wt{f} \rho : S^{2n} \rightarrow S^{2n}$$, as in the diagram:

Then, there is an $$x$$ with $$g(x) = x$$ or $$g(x) = -x$$.
Then, $$f(\rho(x)) = f([x]) = \rho(g(x)) = [x]$$, since $$\rho(x) = \rho(-x) = [x]$$.
Thus, $$f$$ has a fixed point $$[x]$$.


We end by demonstrating a map from $$\mathbb{R}P^{2n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2n-1}$$ that does *not* have a fixed point.
First consider a linear transformation $$g : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2n}$$ without eigenvectors in $$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$$.
A perfectly good example is the map $$g$$ defined by the $$2n \times 2n$$ matrix:

$$
g = \tmat{0}{-I_n}{I_n}{0}
$$

This map has eigenvalues $$\pm i$$.

We identify $$\mathbb{R}P^{2n-1}$$ with the set of lines through the origin in $$\mathbb{R}^{2n}$$ (i.e. one dimensional subspaces), and show that $$g$$ induces a well-defined map.
Indeed, $$g$$ has full rank so it certainly sends one-dimensional subspaces to other one-dimensional subspaces, so this is a well defined map $$\mathbb{R}P^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^2$$.
Since it has no real eigenvalues, none of these one-dimensional subspaces are mapped onto themselves, so this map has no fixed points.
