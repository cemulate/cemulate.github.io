description: A non-vanishing vector field on the solid ball has a point where it point radially outward, and another where it points radially inward
---



**Theorem**:
If $$f : S^n \rightarrow S^n$$ is of degree zero, then there are points $$x,y$$ with $$f(x) = x$$ and $$f(y) = -y$$.

---

*Proof*:
If $$f$$ does *not* have a fixed point, then it is of degree $$\pm 1 \neq 0$$.
Conversely, if $$f$$ is of degree zero it must have a fixed point.

Since $$f$$ is of degree zero, we have $$\deg (-f) = 0$$ as well since degree is multiplicative with respect to composition.
Then, by the same argument as before, we conclude that $$-f$$ must have a fixed point $$y$$, so that $$-f(y) = y$$ and thus $$f(y) = -y$$.


**Corollary**:
A continuous non-vanishing vector field $$F$$ on $$D^n \subset \mathbb{R}^n$$ has a point on the boundary where $$F$$ points radially inward, and another where it points radially outward.

---

*Proof*:
Since $$F$$ is non-vanishing, we can normalize it, letting $$\what{F} = F / \norm{F}$$.
Then, $$\im \what{F} \subseteq S^{n-1}$$.
Now, we have a map $$G: S^{n-1} \xrightarrow{i} D^n \xrightarrow{\what{F}} S^{n-1}$$.
Since the map factors through a contractible space, $$G_* = 0$$, and $$G$$ is of degree zero.
Then, applying the theorem we have $$x$$ and $$y$$ with $$G(x) = x$$ and $$G(y) = -y$$.
Then, since the first map in $$G$$ is just the inclusion, we have $$\what{F} = x$$ and $$\what{F}(y) = -y$$.
Then, for the original map $$F$$, we conclude $$F(x)$$ is parallel to $$x$$ and $$F(y)$$ is opposite in direction to $$y$$.
Since $$x$$ and $$y$$ point in the radial direction, this means that $$F(x)$$ "points outward" and $$F(y)$$ "points inward".
