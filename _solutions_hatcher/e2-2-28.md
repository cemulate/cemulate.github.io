**(a)**
Let $$X$$ be the space obtained from the torus $$T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$$ with a Mobius band $$M$$ attached by gluing the its single boundary component to $$S^1 \times \set{x_0}$$.
We compute the homology using Meyer-Vietoris.
As usual, let $$A$$ be $$T^2$$ with a small neighborhood inside $$M$$, and $$B$$ the Mobius band with a small neighborhood inside $$T^2$$.
$$A$$ deformation retracts to $$T^2$$.
We have $$H_1(A) = \mathbb{Z}^2$$ -- let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be the generators, with $$a$$ the edge attached to the boundary of $$M$$.
$$B$$ deformation retracts onto $$M$$.
We have $$H_1(M) = \mathbb{Z}$$, let $$c$$ represent the single generator (the core circle of the strip).
Finally, $$A \cap B$$ deformation retracts onto a circle, so $$H_1(A \cap B) = \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$a$$ is the generator.
The second homology is $$\mathbb{Z}$$ for $$A$$ and zero for the others, so we have $$H_2(A) \oplus H_2(B) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.

$$
0 \rightarrow \wt{H}_2(A) \oplus \wt{H}_2(B) \rightarrow \wt{H}_2(X) \rightarrow \wt{H}_1(A \cap B) \rightarrow \wt{H}_1(A) \oplus \wt{H}_1(B) \rightarrow \wt{H}_1(X) \rightarrow 0 \dots
$$

since $$\wt{H}_0$$ is clearly zero for everything as well.
In terms of generators, then:

$$
0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \wt{H}_2(X) \xrightarrow{\delta} \la a \ra \xrightarrow{\Phi} \la a,b,c \ra \xrightarrow{\Psi} \wt{H}_1(X) \xrightarrow{\delta} 0
$$

First, note that $$\Phi(a) = a - 2c$$, since the boundary of $$M$$ traverses the core circle of $$M$$ twice.
So, we have that $$\Phi$$ is injective, and by exactness $$\im \delta = 0$$ so we must have $$\wt{H}_2(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.
Again by exactness we must have

$$
\wt{H}_1(X) \cong \dfrac{\la a,b,c \ra}{\im \Phi} = \dfrac{\la a,b,c \ra}{\la a-2c \ra}
= \dfrac{\la a-2c,b-2c,c \ra}{\la a-2c \ra} \cong \mathbb{Z}^2
$$


**(b)**
Now $$X$$ is the space obtained by attaching a Mobius strip $$M$$ to $$\mathbb{R}P^2$$ by attaching its boundary to the copy of $$S^1 = \mathbb{R}P^1 \subset \mathbb{R}P^2$$.
Let $$A, B$$ be defined as above, so that $$A$$ deformation retracts onto $$\mathbb{R}P^2$$ and $$B$$ deformation retracts onto $$M$$.
We have $$\wt{H}_1(A) = \mathbb{Z}_2$$ -- let $$a$$ be the generator (which is attached to the boundary of $$M$$).
Again $$H_1(M) = \mathbb{Z}$$ and let $$b$$ be its generator (the core circle of $$M$$).
Finally $$A \cap B$$ deformation retracts onto a circle and so $$\wt{H}_1(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$$ with generator $$a$$.
This time the second homology is zero for all parts.
So, we have:

$$
0 \rightarrow \wt{H}_2(X) \rightarrow \la a \ra \xrightarrow{\Phi} \dfrac{\la a,b \ra}{\la 2a \ra} \xrightarrow{\Psi} \wt{H}_1(X) \rightarrow 0
$$

First note that $$\Phi(a) = [a-2b]$$.
First by exactness we must have $$\wt{H}_2(X) \cong \ker \Phi$$.
$$\Phi$$ is injective $$\wt{H}_2(X) \cong 0$$.
Secondly, we must have $$\wt{H}_1(X) = \la a,b \ra / \la 2a \ra / \im \Phi$$.
The image of $$\Phi$$ in the free module $$\la a,b \ra$$ is $$\la a-2b \ra$$.
So we have

$$
\wt{H}_1(X) \cong \dfrac{\la a,b \ra}{\la 2a, a-2b \ra}
= \dfrac{\la a+2b, b \ra}{\la a+2b, -4b \ra} \cong \mathbb{Z}_4
$$
