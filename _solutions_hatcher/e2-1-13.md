Here, we verify that two homotopic maps $$f \cong g : X \rightarrow Y$$ induce the same homomorphisms, $$f_* = g_* : \wt{H}_n(X) \rightarrow \wt{H}_n(Y)$$, for *reduced* homology groups.
This amounts to showing that $$f_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp$$ remain chain-homotopic when considering the extended chain complex of reduced homology.
So we show:



**Theorem**: If $$f_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp$$ are (normally) chain-homotopic, then they are chain-homotopic in the setting of reduced homology.

*Proof*:
If $$f_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp$$ are (normally) chain-homotopic, we have maps $$P_n : C_n(X) \rightarrow C_{n+1}(Y)$$ that satisfy $$\delta_{n+2} P_{n+1} + P_n \delta_{n+1} = g_\sharp - f_\sharp$$ for all $$n \geq 0$$ and also the *terminal condition* $$\delta_1 P_0 = f_\sharp - g_\sharp$$.



Consider the extended chain complex, where $$f_\sharp, g_\sharp : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$ are defined to be the identity map on the extra $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
In order to have a chain-homotopy now, we need to define a map $$Q$$ in addition to the $$P_n$$'s:

Clearly, for $$n > 0$$, the the chain homotopy condition is still satisfied by the $$P_n$$'s.
We must require in addition that

* (1) $$\delta_1 P_0 + Q \epsilon = f_\sharp - g_\sharp$$
* (2) $$\epsilon Q = f_\sharp - g_\sharp = 0$$ (the terminal condition)


Observe that the terminal condition actually forces $$Q$$ to be the zero map (since $$\epsilon$$ is injective).
Letting $$Q$$ be the zero map, the first condition becomes $$\delta_1 P_0 = f_\sharp - g_\sharp$$, which is precisely the original terminal condition that we know $$P_0$$ satisfies.
So, taking $$Q$$ to be the zero map satisfies both conditions, and makes the collection of maps $$\set{P_n} \cup Q$$ into a (reduced) chain-homotopy between $$f_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp$$.
