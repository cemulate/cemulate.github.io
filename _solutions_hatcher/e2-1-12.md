**Theorem**: Chain homotopy of chain maps is an equivalence relation.

----

*Proof*:
Suppose we have chain maps $$f_\sharp, g_\sharp, h_\sharp : C_n(X) \rightarrow C_n(Y)$$.
For $$f_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp$$ to be *chain-homotopic*, which we will denote for the duration of this proof by $$f_\sharp \sim g_\sharp$$, means that there exists a map $$P : C_n(X) \rightarrow C_{n+1}(Y)$$ such that $$\delta_{n+2} P_{n+1} + P_n \delta_{n+1} = g_\sharp - f_\sharp$$ (for all $$n$$).
We will abuse notation and and just write the left side as $$\delta P + P \delta$$, leaving the particular instance (subscripts) of $$\delta$$ and $$P$$ to be inferred from the context.



Clearly, $$\sim$$ is reflexive.
Simply take $$P_0$$ to be the zero map, and we have $$\delta P_0 + P_0 \delta = 0 = f_\sharp - f_\sharp$$.
So, $$f_\sharp \sim f_\sharp$$.



It's also easy to see that $$\sim$$ is symmetric.
Suppose $$f_\sharp \sim g_\sharp$$ so that $$\delta P + P \delta = f_\sharp - g_\sharp$$ for some $$P$$.
Then, we have $$g_\sharp - f_\sharp = - (\delta P + P \delta) = \delta (-P) + (-P) \delta$$.
So $$g_\sharp \sim f_\sharp$$ via the map $$-P$$.



Finally, suppose $$f_\sharp \sim g_\sharp$$ and $$g_\sharp \sim h_\sharp$$.
Then, we have $$\delta Q + Q \delta = f_\sharp - g_\sharp$$ and $$\delta R + R \delta = g_\sharp - h_\sharp$$ for maps $$Q$$ and $$R$$.
Then,
$$
f_\sharp - h_\sharp = (f_\sharp - g_\sharp) + (g_\sharp - h_\sharp) = \delta Q + Q \delta + \delta R + R \delta = \delta (Q + R) + (Q + R) \delta
$$

This last line perhaps merits a bit of explanation -- since these are all maps between abelian groups, addition of maps (defined in the obvious way) is clearly commutative, and the fact that $$\delta$$ can factor out of sums follows from the fact that $$\delta$$ is a homomorphism.
So, $$f_\sharp \sim h_\sharp$$ via the map $$Q+R$$.



So, chain-homotopy is an equivalence relation.
