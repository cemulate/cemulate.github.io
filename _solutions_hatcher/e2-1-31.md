We give an example of the situation in the five-lemma where the middle isomorphism is non-zero but all others are zero.
Consider the following commutative diagram:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/hatcher/e2-1-31_1.svg" width="700"/></div>

Certainly, the rows are exact (because $$0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 0$$ is exact and since the endpoints are $$0$$'s, we can augment with more $$0$$'s).
It's also worth ensuring that the diagram is actually commutative.
Only the second and third squares are in question.
In the second square, we see that $$\text{id} \circ 0 = 0 = 0 \circ \text{id}$$, so the second square is commutative.
The third square is verified by a similar observation (note the diagram would *not* be commutative if we switched the rows!).

So, this gives an example where all vertical maps are zero except the middle one, which is the (non-trivial) identity $$\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$.
