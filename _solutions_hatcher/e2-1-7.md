We wish to obtain $$S^3$$ as the quotient space of $$\Delta^3$$, the tetrahedron, by identifying faces of its boundary.
The construction is as follows:



Label the vertices of $$\Delta^3$$ as $$\set{0,1,2,3}$$ (these do not refer to equivalence classes, this is simply a way to refer to the faces of $$\Delta^3$$):

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/hatcher/e2-1-7_1.svg" width="300"/></div>

We will use simple concatenation to refer to a face, i.e. $$[012]$$.
We start with four unique vertices, six unique edges, four unique faces, and one unique three-simplex.
As a first step, identify $$[013] \sim [213]$$ (**note** the orientation of the identification!) -- call this class $$R$$.
This induces the edge identifications $$[03] \sim [23]$$ (call this class $$a$$), $$[01] \sim [21]$$ (call this class $$b$$), and vertex identifications $$[0] \sim [2]$$ (call this class $$v$$).
The result now has three unique vertices, four unique edges, three unique faces, and one unique three simplex.
Now, identify the other two faces $$[021] \sim [023]$$ (call this class $$S$$).
This induces edge identifications $$[21] \sim [23]$$ and $$[01] \sim [03]$$ (so all edges in $$b$$ get identified to ones in $$a$$, so just call this whole class $$a$$, which now has four members), and the vertex identifications $$[1] \sim [3]$$ (call this class $$w$$).
We now have two unique vertices, three unique edges (put the two remaining unidentified edges in classes $$b$$ and $$c$$), two unique faces, and one unique three-simplex.
So, we finally have:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{Vertices:} & v = \set{[0],[2]}, w = \set{[1],[3]} \\[0.1in]
\text{Edges:} & a = \set{[01],[03],[21],[23]}, b = \set{[02]}, c = \set{[13]} \\[0.1in]
\text{Faces:} & R = \set{[013],[213]}, S = \set{[021],[023]}
\end{array}
$$

For a geometric argument as to why this is homeomorphic to $$S^3$$, consider the following:
Imagine performing the first identification by taking the two faces and pulling them around toward each other, using the edge incident to both of them as a pivot.
After this, we end up with a double cone, with vertices $$[1]$$ and $$[3]$$ as the antipodal tips.
The cones themselves are $$[021]$$ and $$[023]$$.
Then, this is homeomorphic to $$D^3$$, and the faces represent the upper and lower hemisphere.
When, we identify them directly, the quotient space becomes $$S^3$$ (this works the same as taking $$D^2$$ and identifying the upper semi-circle $$D^1$$ with the lower semi-circle $$D^1$$, we seal these 'lines' together and close off the space yielding $$S^2$$ -- this generalizes to our higher dimensional case).



Finally, we compute the homology.
From the equivalence classes above, we have $$\Delta_0 = \set{v,w}$$, $$\Delta_1 = \set{a,b,c}$$, $$\Delta_2 = \set{R,S}$$, and $$\Delta_3 = \set{\mathcal{T}}$$.



For $$\delta_0$$, we have $$\im \delta_0 = \set{0}$$ and $$\ker \delta_0 = \Delta_0$$.



For $$\delta_1$$, we have

$$
\begin{align}
& \delta_1(a) = \delta_1([01]) = [1] - [0] = (w) - (v) = w-v \\
& \delta_1(b) = \delta_1([02]) = [2] - [0] = (v) - (v) = 0 \\
& \delta_1(c) = \delta_1([13]) = [3] - [1] = (w) - (w) = 0
\end{align}
$$

So $$\im \delta_1 = \la w-v \ra$$.
On the other hand, $$\ker \delta_1 = \la b,c \ra$$.



For $$\delta_2$$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
& \delta_2(R) = \delta_2([013]) = [13] - [03] + [01] = (c) - (a) + (a) = c \\
& \delta_2(S) = \delta_2([021]) = [21] - [01] + [02] = (a) - (a) + (b) = b
\end{align*}
$$

So, $$\im \delta_2 = \la b,c \ra$$ and $$\ker \delta_2 = \set{0}$$.



For $$\delta_3$$, we have

$$
\begin{align*}
& \delta_3(\mathcal{T}) = \delta_3([0123]) = [123] - [023] + [013] - [012] = (-R) - (S) + (R) - (-S) = 0
\end{align*}
$$

So $$\im \delta_3 = \set{0}$$ and $$\ker \delta_3 = \Delta_3$$.
$$\delta_4$$ and higher are the zero map.
Then we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
& H_0 = \la v, w \ra / \la v-w \ra \cong \mathbb{Z} \\
& H_1 = \la b, c \ra / \la b,c \ra \cong \set{0} \\
& H_2 = \set{0} / \set{0} \cong \set{0} \\
& H_3 = \la \mathcal{T} \ra / \set{0} \cong \mathbb{Z}
\end{align*}
$$
