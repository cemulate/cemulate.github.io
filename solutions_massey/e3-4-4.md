**Theorem**:
Let $$G$$ and $$H$$ be groups.
If an element of $$G * H$$ has finite order, then it is either an element of $$G$$ or $$H$$, or conjugate to an element of $$G$$ or $$H$$.

----

*Proof*:
Let $$x \in G * H$$.
We induct on the length of $$x$$.



If $$\abs{x} = 1$$, then clearly, $$x$$ must be an element of $$G$$ or an element of $$H$$, so the property holds trivially.



Suppose the property holds for all $$\abs{x} < k$$ for some $$k \geq 1$$.
Let $$x \in G * H$$ be of length $$k$$, so we have $$x = x_1 \dots x_k$$,
and suppose $$x$$ has finite order -- that is, $$x^r = 1$$ for some $$r$$.
Observe the powers of $$x$$:

$$
x^a = x_1 \dots x_k x_1 \dots x_k \dots  \text{ (a times)}
$$

It's clear that if $$x_1$$ and $$x_k$$ are from different groups, $$x$$ has infinite order, because no simplification can occur in any power of $$x$$.
So it must be the case that $$x_1$$ and $$x_k$$ are in the same group.
Then, let the product $$x_k x_1 = a$$ and note that:

$$
(x_k) (x) (x_k^{-1}) = a x_2 \dots x_{k-1}
$$

Which is of length $$k-1$$.
So, by the inductive hypothesis, its conjugate to an element of $$G$$ or $$H$$:

$$
a x_2 \dots x_{k-1} = b g b^{-1}
$$

For some $$g \in G \tor H$$ and $$b \in G * H$$.
Putting it together, we have:

$$
x = (x_k^{-1} b) (g) (b^{-1} x_k)
$$

So $$x$$ is conjugate to an element of $$G$$ or $$H$$ (and this is true for any arbitrary word of length $$k$$).



It follows by induction that any word with finite order is conjugate to an element of $$G$$ or $$H$$.
