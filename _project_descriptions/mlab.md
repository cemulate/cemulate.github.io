A satire generator making fun of the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage), a wiki for higher mathematics and category theory.
Generates totally legitmate articles about totally legitimate category theory.

It works using my package [nearley-generator](https://github.com/cemulate/nearley-generator), which turns a [Nearley grammar](https://nearley.js.org/) into an efficient fake-text generator.
