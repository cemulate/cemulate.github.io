Construct a collection of standard and/or completely custom polyominos, and an arbitrary region to fit them in, and this web app will find and display a valid tiling that places all of the polyominos in the region (if it exists).
The app works by reducing the problem to an [exact cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) problem and applying Knuth's [Algorithm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X).
