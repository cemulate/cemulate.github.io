A python program that compiles a very simplified ["HDL"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language) to a Minecraft schematic that can be loaded into a Minecraft world by [worldedit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldedit/).
It compiles the description of the digital circuit in the input file to a redstone implementation in Minecraft.
This project was written in 2011-2012, and it's safe to say that redstone technology has come quite far in that time (not to mention the advent of command blocks), making this project just a fun proof of concept.
