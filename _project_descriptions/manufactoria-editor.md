A modern re-skinned editor for levels in the classic game [Manufactoria](http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/).
Save and load programs from regular classic Manufactoria share URLs, and automate the verification of your programs by providing a test function in javascript.
Credit goes to [@wkevina](https://github.com/wkevina) for most of the architecture and editor code -- I merely wrote the interpreter and the automated testing.

As part of an exercise in learning Haskell, I also wrote a [Haskell interpreter](https://github.com/cemulate/haskell-manufactoria-interpreter) for the [Manufactoria Esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Manufactoria), a programming language that (essentially) implements Manufactoria.
