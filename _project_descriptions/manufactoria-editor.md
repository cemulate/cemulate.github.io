A modern re-skinned editor for levels in the classic game [Manufactoria](http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/).
Save and load programs from regular classic Manufactoria share URLs, and automate the verification of your programs by providing a test function in javascript.
The app was built initially by [@wkevina](https://github.com/wkevina), and I mainly contributed the automated testing.
See also my [interpreter](https://github.com/cemulate/haskell-manufactoria-interpreter) for the [Manufactoria esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Manufactoria).
