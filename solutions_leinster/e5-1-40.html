             <p>For a category <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{A}</script> and object <script type="math/tex">A</script>, let <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Monic}(A)</script> denote the full subcategory of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{A} / A</script> whose objects are the monic morphisms.
A <em>subobject</em> of <script type="math/tex">A</script> is an isomorphism class of objects in <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Monic}(A)</script>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>:
Let <script type="math/tex">X \xrightarrow{m} A</script> and <script type="math/tex">Y \xrightarrow{n} A</script> be monics in <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Set}</script>.</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(X, m)$$ and $$(Y, n)$$ are isomorphic in $$\mathbf{Monic}(A)$$ if and only if $$m$$ and $$n$$ have the same image.


*Proof*:
Suppose $$m$$ and $$n$$ have the same image.
Denote $$S = m(X) = n(Y)$$.
Then in fact $$m$$ and $$n$$ are bijections, considered as $$m : X \rightarrow S$$ and $$n : Y \rightarrow S$$.
Take $$f = n^{-1} \circ m : X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$g = m^{-1} \circ n : Y \rightarrow X$$.
Clearly $$(X, f)$$ is a morphism in $$\mathbf{Monic}(A)$$: $$n \circ f = n \circ n^{-1} \circ m = m$$ and similarly for $$(Y, g)$$.
It's tirival then that $$f \circ g = g \circ f = \id$$, so $$(X, f)$$ and $$(Y, n)$$ are isomorphic.

Suppose $$(X, m)$$ and $$(Y, n)$$ are isomorphic.
Then, we have $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ and $$g : Y \rightarrow X$$ that are morphisms in $$\mathbf{Monic}(A)$$ (meaning $$n \circ f = m$$ and $$m \circ g = n$$), and furthermore $$f$$ and $$g$$ are (mutually inverse) isomorphisms.
The latter fact is actually not needed for this direction.
Observe that that the first equality guarantees that anything in the image of $$m$$ is in the image of $$n$$, and the second guarantees that anything in the image of $$n$$ in the in the image of $$m$$.
So, $$m(X) = n(Y)$$.

$$\mjqed</script><p>So, we have that subobjects of a set <script type="math/tex">A</script> are in canonical correspondence with the subsets of <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>
<p>In <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Top}</script>, the situation calls for a bit more subtlety.
There exist monics in <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{Top}</script> that that have the same subspace as an image, but are not isomorphic.
Consider the space <script type="math/tex">A = [0, 2\pi)</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = [0, 2\pi]</script>.
In both cases, consider the map <script type="math/tex">f : t \mapsto (\cos t, \sin t)</script>.
So we have <script type="math/tex">A \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}^2</script> and <script type="math/tex">B \xrightarrow{f} \mathbb{R}^2</script> that are monics with the same image (<script type="math/tex">S^1</script>), but <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> are not homeomorphic, and hence these are two <em>different</em> subobjects.
However, isomorphism classes of <em>embeddings</em> (a continuous injective function that is homeomorphic onto its image) do correspond one-to-one with subspaces.</p>
