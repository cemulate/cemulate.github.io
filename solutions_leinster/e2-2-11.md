description: Every adjunction restrictions to an equivalence between (full) subcategories
---

**Theorem**:
Every adjunction restrictions to an *equivalence* between (full) subcategories


*Proof*:
Let $$F : \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$$ and $$G: \mathbf{B} \rightarrow \mathbf{A}$$ be an adjunction with $$F \dashv G$$.
Let $$\eta$$ be the unit and $$\varepsilon$$ the counit.
Let $$\mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$ be the subcategory of $$\mathbf{A}$$ where the objects are $$\setbuilder{A \in \mathbf{A}}{\eta_A \text{ is an isomorphism}}$$.
For morphisms, let $$\mathbf{Fix}(GF)(A, A') = \mathbf{A}(A, A')$$, so that $$\mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$ is a full subcategory.
Define dually $$\mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$, a full subcategory of $$\mathbf{B}$$.
If $$A \in \mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$, we claim that $$F(A) \in \mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$.
Indeed, by the triangle identity we have $$\varepsilon_{F(A)} \circ F(\eta_A) = 1_{F(A)}$$.
Since $$\eta_A$$ is an isomorphism, so is $$F(\eta_A)$$, which means that $$\varepsilon_{F(A)}$$ is its inverse, an isomorphism as well.
Thus, since $$\varepsilon_{F(A)}$$ is an isomorphism, $$F(A) \in \mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$.
A dual argument using the other triangle identity shows that $$B \in \mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$ implies $$G(B) \in \mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$.
Thus, $$F$$ and $$G$$ restrict to functors $$F' : \mathbf{Fix}(GF) \rightarrow \mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$ and $$G' : \mathbf{Fix}(FG) \rightarrow \mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$.
$$\eta'$$ and $$\varepsilon'$$, the restrictions of $$\eta$$ and $$\varepsilon$$, are trivially natural isomorphisms because each of their components are isomorphisms, by construction.
Then, $$(F', G', \eta', \varepsilon')$$ is an equivalence of categories between $$\mathbf{Fix}(GF)$$ and $$\mathbf{Fix}(FG)$$.
