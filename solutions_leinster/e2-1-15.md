**Theorem**:
Left adjoints preserve initial objects


*Proof*:
Let $$F : \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$$ and $$G: \mathbf{B} \rightarrow \mathbf{A}$$ be functors with $$F \dashv G$$.
Let $$I \in \mathbf{A}$$ be an initial object.
Let $$B$$ be any object of $$\mathbf{B}$$.
Then, we have $$\Hom(F(I), B) \cong \Hom(I, G(B))$$.
Since $$I$$ is initial the right term has exactly one element, which means the left one does as well.
Since $$B$$ was arbitrary, this means there is exactly one arrow $$F(I) \rightarrow B$$ for any $$B \in \mathbf{B}$$, and so $$F(I)$$ is initial in $$\mathbf{B}$$.

A similar argument shows that right adjoints preserve terminal objects.
