             <p><strong>Theorem</strong>: The language <script type="math/tex">C = \setbuilder{x\#y}{x, y \in \set{0,1}^* \tand x \neq y}</script> is context free.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Proof</em>:
Note that <script type="math/tex">z \in C</script> if and only if <script type="math/tex">z</script> is of the form <script type="math/tex">x \# y</script> and one of the following is true:
(1) <script type="math/tex">|x| < |y|</script>, (2) <script type="math/tex">|y| < |x|</script>, or (3) <script type="math/tex">|x| = |y|</script> and there is some <script type="math/tex">n</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x_n \neq y_n</script>.</p>
<p>Let the stack alphabet be <script type="math/tex">\set{k, Z}</script> with bottom stack symbol <script type="math/tex">Z</script>, and let <script type="math/tex">x</script> represent an arbitrary member of <script type="math/tex">\set{0, 1}</script>.
We design a PDA as follows:</p>
<div class="math-figure"><img src="/assets/math_solutions/sipser/e2-22_1.svg" width="700"/></div>

<p>First, the machine progresses through the substring <script type="math/tex">x</script>, pushing a <script type="math/tex">k</script> onto the stack each time it reads a character.
Note that, after reading <script type="math/tex">n</script> characters, the machine is in <script type="math/tex">q_0</script> or <script type="math/tex">q_1</script> if the <script type="math/tex">n</script>&#39;th character was <script type="math/tex">0</script> or <script type="math/tex">1</script> respectively, and has <script type="math/tex">n</script> instances of <script type="math/tex">k</script> on the stack.</p>
<p>The bottom path <script type="math/tex">q_{u1} \rightarrow q_e \rightarrow q_{u2}</script> (for &#39;unequal&#39;, &#39;equal&#39;, and &#39;unequal&#39;, respectively) handles length comparison.
After the <script type="math/tex">\#</script> is read, it immediately accepts until the stack is emptied, at which point the strings are equal length, at which case the machine is in <script type="math/tex">q_e</script>.
Here, we do not accept on length comparison, and instead rely on the machine to be in <script type="math/tex">q_a</script> to accept (explained below).
If any more input is received, the machine goes to <script type="math/tex">q_{u2}</script> and is permanently accepting again.
In addition, if a <script type="math/tex">\#</script> is read as the first character, the two strings are equal length because they are both empty, so the start state transitions to <script type="math/tex">q_e</script>.</p>
<p>The other path handles comparison on equal-length strings.
Every time a character is read, the machine &#39;spawns a thread&#39; that immediately progresses to <script type="math/tex">q_{0i}</script> or <script type="math/tex">q_{1i}</script>.
The &#39;spawned thread&#39; has knowledge of what the <script type="math/tex">n</script>&#39;th character of <script type="math/tex">x</script> was, along with <script type="math/tex">n</script> instances of <script type="math/tex">k</script> on the stack.
This thread then ignores the rest of <script type="math/tex">x</script>, and waits for a <script type="math/tex">\#</script> symbol.
Finally, each version of the machine that makes it to <script type="math/tex">q_{0c}</script> or <script type="math/tex">q_{1c}</script> progresses to the <script type="math/tex">n</script>&#39;th character of <script type="math/tex">y</script> (by popping the <script type="math/tex">n</script> instances of <script type="math/tex">k</script> off the stack) and tests if the <script type="math/tex">n</script>&#39;th character of <script type="math/tex">y</script> is different than what it knew was the <script type="math/tex">n</script>&#39;th character of <script type="math/tex">x</script>.
If this test ever passes, a version of the machine enters <script type="math/tex">q_a</script> and stays there forever, ensuring that the string is accepted.</p>
<p>This machine accepts <script type="math/tex">C</script>, so <script type="math/tex">C</script> is context-free.</p>
