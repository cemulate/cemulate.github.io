**Theorem**: The language $$F = \setbuilder{a^i b^j}{i = kj \text{ for some } k}$$ is not context-free.

----

*Proof*:
Suppose $$F$$ were context-free, and let $$p$$ be the pumping length.
Let $$q$$ be a number strictly greater than $$p$$, and let $$z = a^{q^2} b^q$$.
Note $$|z| \geq p$$ and $$z \in F$$.
Let $$z = uvwxy$$ with $$|vwx| \leq p$$ and $$|vx| \geq 1$$.
Consider cases.



Suppose $$v$$ and $$x$$ consist entirely of $$a$$'s.
That is, $$v=a^n$$ and $$x = a^m$$ for some $$n, m$$ with $$1 \leq n+m \leq p$$.
Notice that $$\#_a(u v^0 w x^0 y) = q^2 - (n+m)$$.
Now, we use the strict requirements on $$q$$ to note that:

$$
q^2 - q < q^2 - (n+m) < q^2
$$

with strict inequalities, so $$q$$ cannot possibly divide the middle quantity.
Therefore, the number of $$b$$'s does not divide the number of $$a$$'s and $$u v^0 w x^0 y \not\in F$$.



Suppose $$v$$ and $$x$$ consist entirely of $$b$$'s.
Then $$u v^i w x^i y$$ will only have a strictly increasing number of $$b$$'s as $$i$$ increases.
So $$i$$ can certainly be picked such that $$\#_b(u v^i w x^i y) > q^2$$, then the the number of $$b$$'s does not divide the number of $$a$$'s, and $$u v^i w x^i y \not\in F$$.



In the case that $$v$$ or $$x$$ contains mixed characters, that is, some $$a$$'s and some $$b$$'s, then $$u v^2 w x^2 y$$ is not of the form $$a^* b^*$$, and not in $$F$$.



Finally, we consider the case where $$v$$ consists only of $$a$$'s and $$x$$ consists only of $$b$$'s.
So $$v = a^n$$ and $$x = b^m$$ for some $$n \geq 1$$, $$m \geq 1$$, and $$n+m \leq p$$.
Let $$a(i) = \#_a(u v^i w x^i y)$$ and $$b(i) = \#_b(u v^i w x^i y)$$.
An $$i$$-pumped string is in $$F$$ if and only if $$a(i)/b(i)$$ is an integer.
We have, for any positive $$i$$:

$$
r_i = \dfrac{a(i)}{b(i)} = \dfrac{q^2 + (i-1)n}{q + (i-1)m}
$$

Note that $$r_1 = q$$, $$r_i$$ is strictly decreasing, and converges to $$n/m$$ as $$i \rightarrow \infty$$.
Since there are clearly only a finite number of integers (if any) between $$q$$ and $$n/m$$, there must be some $$i$$ such that $$r_i$$ is not an integer.
So, for that choice of $$i$$, $$u v^i w x^i y \not\in F$$.



This contradicts the pumping lemma, so $$F$$ cannot be context-free.
