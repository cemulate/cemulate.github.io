**Theorem**:
Let $$SX$$ be the suspension of $$X$$.
Then, $$\wt{H}_n(SX) \cong \wt{H}_{n-1}(X)$$ for all $$n$$.

---

*Proof*:
Let $$SX = X \times I$$ with $$X \times \set{0}$$ and $$X \times \set{1}$$ both identified to (distinct) points.
Let $$A = X \times [0,\frac{3}{4}]$$ and $$B = X \times [\frac{1}{4},1]$$ (any overlap will do).
Then, $$A \cup B$$ is certainly $$SX$$.
$$A$$ and $$B$$ are both contractible, having $$\wt{H}_n(A) = \wt{H}_n(B) = 0$$ for all $$n$$, and $$A \cap B$$ deformation retracts onto $$X$$, so $$\wt{H}_n(A \cap B) = \wt{H}_n(X)$$.
Meyer-Vietoris gives:

$$
\dots \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \wt{H}_n(SX) \rightarrow \wt{H}_{n-1}(X) \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \dots
$$

for all $$n$$, and the statement is immediate.
