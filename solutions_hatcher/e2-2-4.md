description: Exhibiting a surjective map $$S^n \rightarrow S^n$$ of degree zero
---


We wish to construct a surjective map $$S^n \rightarrow S^n$$ of degree zero.
Since degree is multiplicative with respect to composition, we only need the map to factor through a contractible space.

Consider $$S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$$.
Let $$f : S^n \rightarrow D^n$$ be the map $$f(x_1, x_2 \dots) = (\abs{x_1}, x_2,  \dots)$$.
This is a projection onto one of the hemispheres of $$S^n$$.
Then, just let $$\pi$$ be the quotient map $$\pi : D^n \rightarrow D^n / \partial D^n \cong S^n$$.
Then, $$\pi f : S^n \twoheadrightarrow D^n \twoheadrightarrow S^n$$ is a surjective map, and it has degree zero because it factors through the contractible space $$D^n$$.
