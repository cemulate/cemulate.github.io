description: Computing the homology of $$\Delta^k$$ when all faces of the same dimension are identified
---


Consider the space $$X$$ obtained as the quotient space of $$\Delta^k$$ when all faces of the same dimension are identified.
Fix an ordering on the vertices of $$\Delta^k$$, say $$v_0, \dots, v_k$$.
We compute the homology groups:



We have, for each $$n$$, $$\Delta_n = \la e_n \ra \cong \mathbb{Z}$$ where $$e_n$$ is the equivalence class containing all $$n$$-dimensional faces.
WLOG, we can use $$[v_0 \dots v_n]$$ as a representative for $$e_n$$.



First, consider $$n < k$$.
We have:

$$
\delta_n(e_n) = \delta_n([v_0 \dots v_n]) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^i [v_0 \dots \widehat{v_i} \dots v_n] = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i e_{n-1} = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr}
e_{n-1} & n \text{ is even} \\
0 & n \text{ is odd}
\end{array} \right.
$$

And (note, $$\delta_{n+1}$$ is not the zero map, because $$n < k$$):

$$
\delta_{n+1}(e_{n+1}) = \delta_{n+1}([v_0 \dots v_{n+1}]) = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^n [v_0 \dots \widehat{v_i} \dots v_{n+1}] = \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} (-1)^n e_n = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
0 & n \text{ is even} \\
e_n & n \text{ is odd}
\end{array} \right.
$$

So, when $$n$$ is even, we have $$\ker \delta_n = \set{0}$$ and $$\im \delta_{n+1} = \set{0}$$.
When $$n$$ is odd, we have $$\ker \delta_n = \la e_n \ra$$, and $$\im \delta_{n+1} = \la e_n \ra$$.
Then, in both cases, $$H_n(X) \cong \set{0}$$.



Now consider $$n=k$$.
If $$k$$ is even, then $$\ker \delta_k = \set{0}$$, by the same argument as above.
Since $$\delta_{k+1}$$ is the zero map, $$\im \delta_{k+1} = \set{0}$$ and we have $$H_k(X) = \set{0} / \set{0} \cong \set{0}$$.
However, if $$k$$ is odd, we have $$\ker \delta_n = \la e_k \ra$$, by the same argument as above.
But, since $$\delta_{k+1}$$ is still the zero map, we have $$\im \delta_{k+1} = \set{0}$$ and $$H_n(X) = \la e_n \ra / \set{0} \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.
To summarize,

$$
H_n(X) = \set{0}, n < k \qquad H_k(X) = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
\set{0} & k \text{ is even} \\
\mathbb{Z} & k \text{ is odd}
\end{array} \right.
$$
