Suppose that for any two points $$x,y \in X$$, all path classes from $$x$$ to $$y$$ induce the same isomorphism $$\pi(X,x) \rightarrow \pi(X,y)$$.
From the last exercise, we see that any two paths in the space $$\gamma_1, \gamma_2$$ (between *any* points because $$x$$ and $$y$$ are arbitrary), must have the property that $$\gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1}$$ is in the center of $$\pi(X,x)$$.
But, any loop in $$\pi(X,x)$$ can be considered as the product of a path to some other point $$y$$ and its inverse.
So, every member of $$\pi(X,x)$$ is in the center.
That is, the fundamental group of $$X$$ must be abelian.
