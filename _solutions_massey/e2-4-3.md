**Theorem**: Suppose $$A$$ is a retract of $$X$$, $$r: X \rightarrow A$$ is the retraction, and $$i : A \rightarrow X$$ is the inclusion.
As usual, let $$i_*$$ and $$r_*$$ be the induced homomorphisms that operate on paths.
If $$i_*\pi(A) = \im(i_*)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$\pi(X)$$, then $$\pi(X)$$ is the direct product of $$\im(i_*)$$ and $$\ker(r_*)$$.

----

*Proof*:
First, note that $$\ker(r_*)$$ is necessarily a normal subgroup of $$\pi(X)$$ ($$r_*$$ is a homomorphism so its kernel is a normal subgroup).
The fact that $$\im(i_*)$$ is normal is a hypothesis.



Second, note that $$\ker(r_*) \cap \im(i_*) = 1$$.
This is apparent from noting that any non-trivial element in $$\im(i_*)$$ would necessarily *not* be in $$\ker(r_*)$$.



Now, we claim that $$(\ker(r_*))(\im(i_*)) = \pi(X)$$.
Clearly, $$\subseteq$$ is trivial, so we show $$\supseteq$$.
Consider an arbitrary $$\alpha \in \pi(X)$$.
Let

$$
\beta = i_* r_* (\alpha) \qquad \gamma = i_* r_* (\alpha)^{-1} \alpha
$$

Note that $$\beta \in \im(i_*)$$, trivially.
To show that $$\gamma \in \ker(r_*)$$, we instead show that $$\gamma^{-1} \in \ker(r_*)$$.
Note that:

$$
\begin{align*}
r_* (\gamma^{-1}) &= r_* (\alpha^{-1} i_* r_* (\alpha)) \\
&= r_* (\alpha^{-1}) r_* (i_* r_* (\alpha)) \\
&= r_* (\alpha)^{-1} r_* i_* r_* (\alpha) \\
&= r_*(\alpha)^{-1} r_* (\alpha)  \\
&= 1
\end{align*}
$$

And so, $$\gamma^{-1} \in \ker(r_*)$$ and $$\gamma$$ is as well.
Then, simply observe that $$\beta \gamma = \alpha$$.
So, any element of $$\pi(X)$$ can be written as a product from $$\ker(r_*)$$ and $$\im(i_*)$$, and we've shown the claim.



So, we have two normal subgroups whose intersection is trivial, and whose product is all of $$\pi(X)$$.
Therefore, we have $$\pi(X) = \ker(r_*) \times \im(i_*)$$.
