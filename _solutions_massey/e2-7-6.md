**Theorem**:
Assume in addition to the hypotheses of 7.5 that there is a continuous map $$c: G \rightarrow G$$ such that for all $$a \in G$$, $$\mu(a, c(a)) = \mu(c(a), a) = e$$.
Then for any $$\beta \in \pi(G,e)$$, $$c_*(\beta) = \beta^{-1}$$.

*Proof*:
For $$\beta \in \pi(G,e)$$, we have

$$
\beta \cdot c_*(\beta) = \mu_*(i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* c_*\beta)
$$

Now, we examine what this path inside $$\mu_*$$ actually is.
We have:

$$
i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* c_*\beta = \left\{
\begin{array}{lr}
(\beta(2t), e) & 0 \leq t \leq 1/2 \\
(e, c(\beta(2t-1))) & 1/2 \leq t \leq 1
\end{array} \right.
$$

This path in $$G \times G$$ performs $$\beta$$ in the first coordinate over the first half of time, and then performs $$c(\beta)$$ in the second coordinate over the second half of time.
This is homotopic to the map that performs $$\beta$$ in the first coordinate and $$c(\beta)$$ in the second, both over the whole time frame.
That is, we have:

$$
i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* c_*\beta \sim f(t) = (\beta(t), c(\beta(t))), 0 \leq t \leq 1
$$

By the hypothesis, $$f(t) = e$$ for all $$t$$, so this is actually the identity map.
Then we have

$$
\beta \cdot c_*(\beta) = \mu_*(i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* c_*\beta) = \mu_*(\epsilon_{(e,e)}) = \epsilon_e
$$

Where the last equivalence comes from applying the first property of $$\mu$$ in the special case of both arguments being $$e$$.
A symmetric argument obtains $$c_*(\beta) \cdot \beta = \epsilon_e$$, so $$c_*(\beta) = \beta^{-1}$$.
