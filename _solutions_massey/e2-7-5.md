**Theorem**:
Let $$G$$ be a topological space, and $$\mu : G \times G \rightarrow G$$ a continuous map.
Let $$e \in G$$ be such that:

* For any $$a \in G$$, $$\mu(a,e) = \mu(e, a) = a$$
* $$i^x(a) = (a,e)$$ and $$i^y(a) = (e,a)$$ for any $$a \in G$$

Where $$i^x$$ and $$i^y$$ are defined as in 7.4.
Then, for any $$\beta,\gamma \in \pi(G,e)$$, $$\mu_* ( i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* \gamma) = \beta \cdot \gamma$$.

*Proof*:
Because $$\mu$$ is continuous, we have $$\mu_* (i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* \gamma) = \mu_*(i^x_* \beta) \cdot \mu_*(i^y_* \gamma)$$.
Now, consider that $$(i^x_* \beta)(t) = (e, \beta(t))$$, by the second property.
Then, $$(\mu_* i^x_* \beta)(t) = \beta(t)$$, by the first property.
That is, $$\mu_* i^x_* \beta = \beta$$, and a symmetric argument obtains $$\mu_* i^y_* \gamma = \gamma$$.
Then, $$\mu_* (i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* \gamma) = \beta \cdot \gamma$$.



By the last exercise (7.4), $$i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* \gamma$$ and $$i^y_* \gamma \cdot i^x_* \beta$$ commute, so for any $$\beta, \gamma \in \pi(G,e)$$, we have

$$
\beta \cdot \gamma = \mu_*(i^x_* \beta \cdot i^y_* \gamma)
= \mu_*(i^y_* \gamma \cdot i^x_* \beta) = \gamma \cdot \beta
$$

So, $$\pi(G,e)$$ is an abelian group.
