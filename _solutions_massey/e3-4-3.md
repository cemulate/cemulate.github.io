**Theorem**:
Let $$\setbuilder{G_i}{i \in I}$$ and $$\setbuilder{G'_i}{i \in I}$$ be two different families of groups indexed by the same set.
Let $$G$$ and $$G'$$ be their free products.
Suppose that for each $$i \in I$$ there is a homomorphism $$f_i : G_i \rightarrow G_i'$$.
Then there is a unique homomorphism $$f : G \rightarrow G'$$ such that the diagram commutes (where the $$\varphi$$'s are the canonical injections):

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/massey/e3-4-3_1.svg" width="150"/></div>

Furthermore, if each $$f_i$$ is injective, $$f$$ is injective, and if each $$f_i$$ is surjective, $$f$$ is surjective.

*Proof*:

Notice that $$\varphi_i' \circ f_i$$ is a homomorphism from $$G_i$$ to $$G'$$.
That is, we have:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/massey/e3-4-3_2.svg" width="150"/></div>

And since $$G$$ is a free group, the definition tells us that there is a unique homomorphism $$f$$ that makes this diagram commute.
Since this really is the same diagram, this $$f$$ also makes the diagram in the original statement commute.



Let $$x_{i_j} \in G_{i_j}$$ for some $$\set{i_1, \dots, i_k} \subset I$$.
Then

$$
w = \varphi_{i_1}(x_{i_1}) \dots \varphi_{i_k}(x_{i_k}) = x_{i_1} \dots x_{i_k} \in G
$$

is an arbitrary element of $$G$$.
Since $$f$$ is a homomorphism and the diagram commutes, we can write:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(w) &= f( \varphi_{i_1}(x_{i_1})) \dots f(\varphi_{i_k}(x_{i_k})) \\
&= \varphi'_{i_1}(f_{i_1}(x_{i_1})) \dots \varphi'_{i_k}(f_{i_k}(x_{i_k})) \\
&= f_{i_1}(x_{i_1}) \dots f_{i_k}(x_{i_k})
\end{align*}
$$

Suppose that the $$f_i$$ are injective.
Observe that the only way $$f(w)$$ could be the identity is if each $$f_{i_j}(x_{i_j})$$ is the identity (otherwise, it would be some definite irreducible word in $$G'$$).
But, this is true only if each $$x_{i_j}$$ is the identity.
But then $$w$$ is the identity.
So, $$\ker f$$ is trivial and $$f$$ is injective.



Suppose the $$f_i$$ are surjective.
Let $$w = g_{i_1} \dots g_{i_k} \in G'$$.
Then there is an $$x_{i_j}$$ such that $$f_{i_j}(x_{i_j}) = g_{i_j}$$ for all $$j$$.
Then, $$g_{i_1} \dots g_{i_k} = f_{i_1}(x_{i_1}) \dots f_{i_k}(x_{i_k}) = f(x_{i_1} \dots x_{i_k})$$.
So there is an element in $$G$$ that maps to $$w$$, and $$f$$ is surjective.
