**(a)** First, we determine all the covering spaces of $$S^1$$.
Note that $$\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$$.
Since this is an abelian group, every subgroup belongs to its own trivial conjugacy class.
That is, each subgroup corresponds to a unique covering space.
The subgroups of $$\mathbb{Z}$$ are precisely $$n\mathbb{Z}$$ for $$n \geq 0$$, with $$n=0$$ corresponding to the trivial subgroup.
For $$n > 0$$, the subgroup $$n\mathbb{Z}$$ is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
For describing covering maps, let $$S^1$$ be the unit circle in $$\mathbb{C}$$.



Corresponding to the trivial group, we have the covering space $$(\mathbb{R}, p)$$ where $$p(x) = \exp(2 \pi i x)$$.



For each $$n > 0$$, the covering space associated with $$n\mathbb{Z}$$ is $$(S^1, p_n)$$ where $$p_n(z) = z^n$$.

**(b)** Now we determine all the covering spaces of $$P^2$$.
Note $$\pi_1(P_2) = \mathbb{Z}_2$$.
Of course, there are exactly two (non-conjugate) subgroups -- the trivial one, and the whole group.
Let $$P^2$$ be quotient of $$[0,1] \times [0,1]$$ under the identification $$\varphi$$ corresponding to identifying the edges in pairs.
Corresponding to the trivial group we have the covering space $$(\mathbb{R}^2_+, p)$$, where $$\mathbb{R}^2_+$$ denotes the first quadrant of $$\mathbb{R}^2$$, and the map is $$p(x, y) = \varphi(x - \lfloor x \rfloor, y - \lfloor y \rfloor)$$.
Corresponding to the whole group we have the trivial covering space $$(P^2, \text{id})$$.

**(c)** We now determine all the covering spaces of the annalus $$X = \setbuilder{x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2}{1 \leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 4}$$.
However, note that this space is homeomorphic to $$S^1 \times [1,4]$$.
The fundamental group is still $$\mathbb{Z}$$, since this deformation retracts to $$S^1$$.



Corresponding to the trivial group, we have the covering space $$(\mathbb{R} \times [1,4], p)$$, where the covering map is $$p(x, t) = (\exp(2\pi i x), t)$$.



Corresponding to $$n\mathbb{Z}$$, we have the covering space $$(S^1 \times [1,4], p_n)$$ where $$p_n(z, t) = (z^n, t)$$.
