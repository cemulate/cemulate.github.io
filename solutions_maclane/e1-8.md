description: Rigorous derivation of the exopnential in a presheaf category (completing the proof the presheaf categories are Cartesian closed)
---


We determine the exponent in a presheaf category.
This is a slightly different formulation than the exponent defined in Proposition 1 of the text, but the proof contains exactly the same concepts and ideas that are key to the original.
In the course of this proof, however, we provide a "few" more details than the authors' proof of Proposition 1.

To set the stage, consider a small category $$\mathbf{C}$$ and $$X \in \mathbf{C}$$ let $$\mathbf{C}/X$$ denote the slice category of pairs $$(A, k : A \rightarrow X)$$, and $$D_X : \mathbf{C} / X \rightarrow \mathbf{C}$$ the forgetful functor.
For a presheaf $$U \in \presheaves{\mathbf{C}}$$, we may form a presheaf $$U_X \in \presheaves{(\mathbf{C}/X)}$$ by $$U_X = U \circ D_X^{\text{op}}$$.
Notice that if we have a map $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ and a natural transformation $$\alpha : U_Y \rightarrow V_Y$$ having components $$\alpha_{A, k}$$, we can form a "pullback along $$f$$" denoted by $$f_* \alpha : U_X \rightarrow V_X$$ and having components $$(f_* \alpha)_{A, k} = \alpha_{A, f \circ k}$$.

**Theorem**:
For $$S, T \in \presheaves{\mathbf{C}}$$, $$T^S$$ is the presheaf defined on objects by $$T^S(X) = \Hom (S_X, T_X)$$ and on maps $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ by $$T^S(f)(\alpha) = f_* \alpha$$.



*Proof*:
We define an evaluation $$e : T^S \times S \rightarrow T$$ with components $$e_X : T^S(X) \times S(X) \rightarrow T(X)$$ by $$e_X(\alpha, x) = \alpha_{X, \id}(x)$$.
We'll show that this evaluation is universal from $$\dash \times S$$ to $$T$$.
That is, given a $$\gamma : U \times S \rightarrow T$$, we must find a *unique* map $$\delta : U \rightarrow T^S$$ factoring through the evaluation:

Define $$\delta$$, having components $$\delta_X : U(X) \rightarrow T^S(X)$$, by $$\delta_X(x)_{A, k} = t \mapsto \gamma_A(\overline{x}_A(k), t)$$, where $$\overline{x}$$ denotes the associated natural transformation $$\Hom(\dash, X) \rightarrow U$$ under the Yoneda correspondence.
After staring at this expression for a very long time, one can be convinced that it does indeed "type-check".

It's straightfoward if a bit messy to verify that $$\delta$$ is actually natural, that is for $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$, $$\delta_X \circ U(f) = T^S(f) \circ \delta_Y$$.
Applying the left side to $$y \in U(Y)$$, we first get $$U(f)(y)$$ and then the natural transformation $$\alpha$$ with $$\alpha_{A,k} = t \mapsto  \gamma_A(\overline{U(f)(y)}_A(k), t)$$.
Applying the other side to $$y$$, we first get the natural transformation $$\beta$$ with $$\beta_{A,k} = t \mapsto \gamma_A(\overline{y}_A(k), t)$$.
We then form $$f_*\beta$$ with $$(f_* \beta)_{A,k} = t \mapsto \alpha'_{A, f \circ k}(t) = \gamma_A(\overline{y}_A(f \circ k), t)$$.
So naturality comes down to showing that $$\overline{U(f)(y)}_A(k) = \overline{y}_A(f \circ k)$$.
In fact, by the definition of the Yoneda correspondence, we have $$\overline{y}_A(f \circ k) = U(f \circ k)(y)$$, while $$\overline{U(f)(y)}_A(k) = U(k)(U(f)(y))$$ -- these expressions are equal precisely because $$U$$ is a contravariant functor.

Next, we verify that $$\delta$$ does actually make the triangle commute, that is for any $$X$$ we have $$e_X \circ (\delta_X \times \id) = \gamma_X$$.
Applying the left side to $$(x, x') \in U(X) \times S(X)$$, we first obtain the pair $$(\alpha, x')$$ with $$\alpha_{A,k} = t \mapsto \gamma_A(\overline{x}_A(k), t)$$.
Then we have $$e_X(\alpha, x') = \alpha_{X,\id}(x') = \gamma_X(\overline{x}_X(\id), x') = \gamma_X(x, x')$$.

Finally, we show uniqueness, which is probably the trickiest part of this proof and also the only part kindly glossed over completely by the authors of the book.
Let $$\delta'$$ be another map making the triangle commute.
From the triangle then, the only requirement imposed on $$\delta'$$ is that for any $$X$$, $$x \in U(X)$$, $$\delta'_X(x)_{X,\id} = t \mapsto \gamma_X(x, t)$$.
Essentially, the evaluation forces $$\delta'_X(x)$$ to be identical to $$\delta_X(x)$$ at the $$(X, \id)$$ component.
We will evaluate $$\delta'_X(x)$$ at the $$(A, k)$$ component, and show that it too is identical to that of $$\delta_X(x)$$.
To find the component at $$(A, k)$$ we use the fact that $$\delta'$$ is natural.
For a map $$f: X \rightarrow Y$$, we have the following naturality square, followed by its evaluation at some $$x \in U(X)$$:

And the two final expressions are of course equal.
Expanding the bottom, then, we have $$(f_*\delta'_Y(x))_{A, k} = \delta'_Y(x)_{A, f \circ k} = \delta'_X(U(f)(x))_{A, k}$$.
Then, a particular application of this final equality says that $$\delta'_X(x)_{A, k \circ id} = \delta'_A(U(k)(x))_{A, \id}$$.
The former expression is exactly $$\delta'_X(x)_{A, k}$$, and the latter's value is fixed from the preceding discussion -- it is required to be precisely $$t \mapsto \gamma_A(U(k)(x), t)$$.
Finally, this is just the expanded form of $$t \mapsto \gamma_A(\overline{x}_A(k), t)$$, exactly the value of $$\delta_X(x)_{A, k}$$.
So, $$\delta'_X(x)$$ has identical components to $$\delta_X(x)$$ and thus $$\delta'_X(x) = \delta_X(x)$$ for every $$X$$ and $$x \in U(X)$$, so ultimately $$\delta' = \delta$$, completing the proof of uniqueness.

Finally, we have defined $$T^S$$ and provided a universal evaluation map, exhibiting $$T^S$$ as the exponent in $$\presheaves{\mathbf{C}}$$.
