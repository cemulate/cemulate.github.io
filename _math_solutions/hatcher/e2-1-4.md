Form the triangular parachute $$P$$ from a regular $$2$$-simplex with all vertices identified to a single vertex.
Label the vertex $$v$$, the edges $$a,b,c$$, and the face $$f$$.
We wish to determine the simplicial homology groups.
We have $$\Delta_0 = \la v \ra, \Delta_1 = \la a,b,c \ra$$ and $$\Delta_2 = \la f \ra$$ (of course, all brackets in this context mean the free *abelian* group on the enclosed generators).



For $$\delta_0$$, we have $$\im \delta_0 = \set{0}$$ and $$\ker \delta_0 = \Delta_0$$.
For $$\delta_1$$, we have $$\delta_1(a) = \delta_1(b) = \delta_1(c) = v-v=0$$.
Thus, $$\im \delta_1 = \set{0}$$ and $$\ker \delta_1 = \Delta_1$$.



For $$\delta_2$$, we have $$\delta_2(f) = a-b+c$$.
Then, $$\ker \delta_2 = \set{0}$$, and $$\im \delta_2$$ is precisely $$I_2 = \setbuilder{ka - kb + kc}{k \in \mathbb{Z}}$$.
$$\delta_3$$ and higher are all the zero map.



It's clear that we have $$H_0(P) = \la v \ra / \set{0} = \la v \ra \cong \mathbb{Z}$$.




Next, $$H_1(P) = \la a,b,c \ra / I_2$$.
Consider the homomorphism $$\varphi : \la a,b,c \ra \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^2$$ given by $$\varphi(ra + sb + tc) = (r-t, s+t)$$.
Observe that $$\ker \varphi$$ is precisely $$\setbuilder{ra + sb + tc}{s=-r, t=r}$$, which is exactly an equivalent description of $$I_2$$.
We conclude $$H_1(P) \cong \im \varphi = \mathbb{Z}^2$$.



$$H_2(P)$$ is $$\set{0}$$ because $$\delta_2$$ is injective, and all higher homology groups are zero as well.
