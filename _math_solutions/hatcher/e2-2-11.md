Let $$X$$ be the space obtained from the cube $$I^3$$ by identifying each face with its opposite face via a right-handed one-quarter twist.
This is a cell-complex structure on the resulting space:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/hatcher/e2-2-11_1.svg" width="300"/></div>

This is a structure with two 0-cells (the marked vertices represent one equivalence class $$p$$ and the rest represent an equivalence class $$q$$), four 1-cells (the labeled edges), three 2-cells (which is clear since we identify the faces in pairs) -- call the front/back $$f$$, left/right $$g$$, and bottom/top $$h$$ -- and one 3-cell $$T$$.
The cellular homology is:

$$
0 \rightarrow \la T \ra \xrightarrow{d_3} \la f,g,h \ra \xrightarrow{d_2} \la a,b,c,d \ra \xrightarrow{d_1} \la p, q \ra \rightarrow 0
$$

The maps are:

$$
d_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c|cccc}
  & a & b & c & d \\ \hline
p & -1 & 1  & -1 & 1 \\
q & 1  & -1 & 1  & -1
\end{array} \right]
\qquad
d_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c|ccc}
  & f & g & h \\ \hline
a & 1 & 1  & 1 \\
b & 1 & 1  & -1 \\
c & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
d & 1 & -1 & 1
\end{array} \right]
$$

To determine $$d_3$$, we compute the degrees of each map in the cellular boundary formula by counting local degrees.
First, consider how $$T$$ is mapped onto the face $$f$$.
The image of the center point of $$f$$ has a preimage consisting of two points -- the center of the front and back face, respectively.
Neighborhoods of these points are mapped homeomorphically onto a neighborhood of the image, so the local degree at each is $$\pm 1$$.
They must have opposite sign, because one neighborhood differs from the other by a reflection and a rotation, and this would multiply the degree by $$-1$$ and $$1$$ respectively, yielding an opposite sign.
Then, the degree of the map is $$1 - 1 = 0$$.
We get the same thing for the other faces, so each coefficient in the sum in the cellular boundary formula is zero, and $$d_3 = 0$$.

Let's compute homology.
We have:

$$
d_1 \xrightarrow{SNF} \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
\qquad
d_2 \xrightarrow{SNF} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array} \right]
$$

Now that we have the maps explicitly and their Smith forms, the homology is just a matter of tabulation:

$$
H_0(X) \cong \mathbb{Z} \qquad H_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2 \qquad H_2(X) = 0
\qquad H_3(X) = \mathbb{Z}
$$
