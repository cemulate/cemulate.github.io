Take a 2-simplex $$[v_0, v_1, v_2]$$ and form the quotient space given by identifying the faces (edges) $$[v_0, v_1]$$ and $$[v_1, v_2]$$ preserving the ordering of vertices.



The resulting quotient space will be a compact surface with boundary, and is homeomorphic to a Mobius strip.
We can see this with the classification of compact surfaces (with boundary):

After identifying the edges, there is one vertex, two edges, and one face, giving $$\chi=0$$, then observing that the the surface is non-orientable (because we have a pair of edges identified in the 'same direction' around the polygon), so the surface is either $$K^2$$ or $$RP^2 - D$$ (the Mobius strip), and since there is at least one boundary component (along the unidentified edge, for instance), it must be $$RP^2 - D$$.
