Let $$x,y \in X$$ and let $$\gamma_1$$ and $$\gamma_2$$ be two path classes from $$x$$ to $$y$$.
We can characterize the conditions under which $$\gamma_1$$ and $$\gamma_2$$ give rise to the same isomorphism $$\pi(X,x) \rightarrow \pi(X,y)$$ by observing the following.



Suppose $$\varphi_1 : \alpha \mapsto \gamma_1^{-1} \alpha \gamma_1$$ and $$\varphi_2 : \alpha \mapsto \gamma_2^{-1} \alpha \gamma_2$$ are the same.
Then we have, for all $$\alpha$$:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \gamma_1^{-1} \alpha \gamma = \gamma_2^{-1} \alpha \gamma_2 \\
\Rightarrow \enspace & \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1} \alpha \gamma_1 \gamma_2^{-1} = \alpha
\end{align*}
$$

Denote $$\beta = \gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1}$$, and notice that $$\beta \in \pi(X,x)$$ and $$\gamma_1 \gamma_2^{-1} = \beta^{-1}$$.
Then we have $$\beta \alpha \beta^{-1} = \alpha$$.
Since this holds for all $$\alpha$$, we have that $$\beta \in Z(\pi(X,x))$$.



By assuming that $$\gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1} \in Z(\pi(X,x))$$, we can reverse the argument above to conclude that $$\varphi_1(\alpha) = \varphi_2(\alpha)$$.



So we have that the isomorphisms induced by $$\gamma_1$$ and $$\gamma_2$$ are identical if and only if $$\gamma_2 \gamma_1^{-1} \in Z(\pi(X,x))$$.
