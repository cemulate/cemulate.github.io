**(a)** **Theorem**: The language $$B = \setbuilder{1^k y}{y \in \set{0, 1}^* \tand \#_1(y) \geq k \text{ for some } k \geq 1}$$ is a regular language.

----

*Proof*:
Notice that strings in $$B$$ must start with $$1$$, since $$k \geq 1$$.
Also, any string of the form $$1x$$ will certainly be in $$B$$ as long as $$x$$ contains at least one 1.
In other words, we have $$B = \setbuilder{1x}{\#_1(x) \geq 1}$$.
So, the following DFA accepts $$B$$:

**(b)** **Theorem**: The language $$C = \setbuilder{1^k y}{y \in \set{0, 1}^* \tand \#_1(y) \leq k \text{ for some } k \geq 1}$$ is not a regular language.

----

*Proof*:
Suppose $$C$$ were regular and let $$p$$ be the pumping length.
Take $$z = 1^p 0 1^p$$, noting that $$z \in C$$ and $$|z| \geq p$$.
Then let $$z = uvw$$ with $$|uv| \leq p$$ and $$|v| \geq 1$$.



Because $$|uv| \leq p$$, and $$uv$$ is a prefix of $$z$$, it must be the case that $$u$$ and $$v$$ consist entirely of $$1$$'s.
In particular, $$v = 1^k$$ for some $$k \geq 1$$.
But then $$u v^0 w = 1^{(p-k)} 0 1^p$$, which is not in $$C$$, contradicting the pumping lemma, so $$C$$ is not regular.
