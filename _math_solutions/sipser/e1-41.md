For languages $$A$$ and $$B$$ over the same alphabet $$\Sigma$$, the perfect shuffle of $$A$$ and $$B$$ is:

$$
S(A, B) = \setbuilder{x}{x = a_1 b_1 \dots a_k b_k \text{ with } a_i, b_i \in \Sigma, a_1 \dots a_k \in A, b_1 \dots b_k \in B}
$$

We show that for regular languages $$A$$ and $$B$$, $$S(A, B)$$ is also regular.

Let $$M_A = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_{0A}, F_A)$$ and $$M_B = (Q_B, \Sigma, \delta_B, q_{0B}, F_B)$$ be DFAs that accept $$A$$ and $$B$$, respectively.
We construct a machine $$M_S = (Q_S, \Sigma, \delta_S, q_{0S}, F_S)$$ that accepts $$S(A, B)$$.



Let $$Q_S = \set{p_A, p_B} \times Q_A \times Q_B$$.
Take $$q_{0S} = (p_A, q_{0A}, q_{0B})$$.
Take $$F_S = \set{p_A, p_B} \times F_A \times F_B$$.



Finally, define:

$$
\delta_S((p, q_1, q_2), x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lr}
(p_B, \delta_A(x), q_2) & p = p_A \\
(p_A, q_1, \delta_B(x)) & p = p_B
\end{array} \right.
$$

So $$M_S$$ alternates between advancing a copy of machine $$M_A$$ and $$M_B$$, keeping track of which machine to advance with $$p_A$$ and $$p_B$$.
So $$M_S$$ accepts $$S(A, B)$$, and $$S(A, B)$$ is regular.
