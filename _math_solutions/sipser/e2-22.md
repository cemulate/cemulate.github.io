title: Sipser Exercise 2.22
---


**Theorem**: The language $$C = \setbuilder{x\#y}{x, y \in \set{0,1}^* \tand x \neq y}$$ is context free.

----

*Proof*:
Note that $$z \in C$$ if and only if $$z$$ is of the form $$x \# y$$ and one of the following is true:
(1) $$|x| < |y|$$, (2) $$|y| < |x|$$, or (3) $$|x| = |y|$$ and there is some $$n$$ such that $$x_n \neq y_n$$.



Let the stack alphabet be $$\set{k, Z}$$ with bottom stack symbol $$Z$$, and let $$x$$ represent an arbitrary member of $$\set{0, 1}$$.
We design a PDA as follows:

First, the machine progresses through the substring $$x$$, pushing a $$k$$ onto the stack each time it reads a character.
Note that, after reading $$n$$ characters, the machine is in $$q_0$$ or $$q_1$$ if the $$n$$'th character was $$0$$ or $$1$$ respectively, and has $$n$$ instances of $$k$$ on the stack.



The bottom path $$q_{u1} \rightarrow q_e \rightarrow q_{u2}$$ (for 'unequal', 'equal', and 'unequal', respectively) handles length comparison.
After the $$\#$$ is read, it immediately accepts until the stack is emptied, at which point the strings are equal length, at which case the machine is in $$q_e$$.
Here, we do not accept on length comparison, and instead rely on the machine to be in $$q_a$$ to accept (explained below).
If any more input is received, the machine goes to $$q_{u2}$$ and is permanently accepting again.
In addition, if a $$\#$$ is read as the first character, the two strings are equal length because they are both empty, so the start state transitions to $$q_e$$.



The other path handles comparison on equal-length strings.
Every time a character is read, the machine 'spawns a thread' that immediately progresses to $$q_{0i}$$ or $$q_{1i}$$.
The 'spawned thread' has knowledge of what the $$n$$'th character of $$x$$ was, along with $$n$$ instances of $$k$$ on the stack.
This thread then ignores the rest of $$x$$, and waits for a $$\#$$ symbol.
Finally, each version of the machine that makes it to $$q_{0c}$$ or $$q_{1c}$$ progresses to the $$n$$'th character of $$y$$ (by popping the $$n$$ instances of $$k$$ off the stack) and tests if the $$n$$'th character of $$y$$ is different than what it knew was the $$n$$'th character of $$x$$.
If this test ever passes, a version of the machine enters $$q_a$$ and stays there forever, ensuring that the string is accepted.



This machine accepts $$C$$, so $$C$$ is context-free.
