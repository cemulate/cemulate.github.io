Consider $$\mathbb{Z}$$ and an arbitrary group $$G$$ as one-object categories.
For each $$g \in G$$, there is a unique functor $$F_g : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow G$$ that sends the arrow $$1$$ to the arrow $$g$$ (such a functor is really just a group homomorphism).
Natural isomorphism between such functors is an equivalence relation.
Suppose $$F_g$$ and $$F_h$$ are naturally isomorphic, say via $$\alpha$$ (note any natural transformation in this setting is necessarily a natural isomorphism, since all arrows are isomorphisms in groups).
$$\alpha$$ only has one component, so we will just abuse notation and refer to the component as $$\alpha$$, which is an arrow/element of $$G$$.
The only thing that "matters" then, about $$\alpha$$ is the naturality relation, which simplifies to the following:
For any $$x$$ an arrow/element of $$\mathbb{Z}$$, we have $$\alpha F_g(x) = F_h(x) \alpha$$.
When $$x=1$$, we have $$\alpha g = h \alpha$$, i.e. $$\alpha g \alpha^{-1} = h$$.
So, natural isomophism of $$F_g$$ and $$F_h$$ implies there exists an $$\alpha$$ such that this occurs -- which is to say that $$g$$ and $$h$$ are conjugate.
So, equivalence classes of these functors under natural isomorphism is the same as conjugacy classes of the group elements.
