$$\newcommand\Ord{\text{Ord}}$$

Let $$\mathbf{B}$$ be the category of finite sets with bijections.
We'll define two functors $$\mathbf{B} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$.
First, define $$\Sym(\dash) : \mathbf{B} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$.
$$\Sym(X)$$ is the set of permutations of $$X$$.
For a bijection $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$, define $$\Sym(f) : \Sym(X) \rightarrow \Sym(Y)$$ by $$\Sym(f)(\sigma) = f \circ \sigma \circ f^{-1}$$.

Now, define $$\Ord(\dash) : \mathbf{B} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$.
$$\Ord(X)$$ is the set of total orders on $$X$$ -- for concreteness, let the elements of $$\Ord(X)$$ be relations in the sense of subsets of $$X \times X$$.
Suppose $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ is a bijection.
Define $$\Ord(f) : \Ord(X) \rightarrow \Ord(Y)$$ by $$\Ord(f)(R) = \setbuilder{(f(x), f(y))}{(x,y) \in R}$$.

**Theorem**:
There is no natural transformation $$\Sym(\dash) \rightarrow \Ord(\dash)$$.


*Proof*:
Assume there were such a natural transformation $$\alpha$$.
Let $$A = \set{0, 1} \in \mathbf{B}$$.
And let $$s$$ be the swapping permutation $$s(0) = 1$$ and $$s(1) = s(0)$$.
Then, we have a component $$\alpha_A$$ and by naturality $$\alpha_A \circ \Sym(s) = \Ord(s) \circ \alpha_A : \Sym(A) \rightarrow \Ord(A)$$.
But, observe that:
$$
(\alpha_A \circ \Sym(s))(1_A) = \alpha_A(s \circ 1_A \circ s^{-1}) = \alpha_A(1_A)
$$
which is some ordering, set $$\alpha_A(1_A) = R$$.
Then,
$$
(\Ord(s) \circ \alpha_A)(1_A) = \Ord(s)(R) = \setbuilder{(s(x), s(y))}{(x,y) \in R}
$$
which is clearly a different ordering than $$R$$, a contradiction.


Thus, since $$\Sym(X)$$ and $$\Ord(X)$$ are the same size as sets, there is a bijection between them and we have $$\Sym(X) \cong \Ord(X)$$ in $$\mathbf{Set}$$ for each $$X$$, but not *naturally*.
That is to say, $$\Sym(\dash)$$ and $$\Ord(\dash)$$ are not naturally isomorphic.
This is a counterexample to the incorrect "converse" one might be willing to draw from exercise 1.3.26.
