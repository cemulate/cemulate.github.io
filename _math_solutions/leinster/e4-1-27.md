title: Exercise 4.1.27

**Theorem**:
Let $$\mathbf{A}$$ be a locally small category and suppose $$A, A' \in \mathbf{A}$$.
If $$H_A \cong H_{A'}$$ then $$A \cong A'$$.
In other words, the Yoneda embedding $$H_{\bullet}$$ is injective on isomorphism classes of objects.


*Proof*:
$$H_A \cong H_{A'}$$ means we have a natural isomorphism $$\alpha : H_A \rightarrow H_{A'}$$.
It has components $$\alpha_X : H_A(X) \rightarrow H_{A'}(X) : \Hom(X, A) \rightarrow \Hom(X, A')$$, which are also isomorphisms (in particular, the hom-sets are in bijection).
Consider $$\alpha_A : \Hom(A, A) \rightarrow \Hom(A, A')$$ and denote $$\ell = \alpha_A(1_A) : A \rightarrow A'$$.
We claim that this is the isomorphism desired.
Indeed, first look at the naturality square of $$\alpha$$ with respect to the arrow $$\ell$$:

(the horizontal arrows in the opposite direction because $$H_A$$ is contravariant).
Keep in mind the vertical arrows are bijections.
The horizontal maps on both top and bottom are given by definition as right-composition by $$\ell$$, i.e. $$p \mapsto p \circ \ell$$.
Since the vertical maps are bijections, we have an $$r \in \Hom(A', A)$$ mapping onto $$1_{A'}$$ via $$\alpha_{A'}$$.
Evaluating the diagram at $$r$$ then gives:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e4-1-27_2.svg" width="300px"/></div>

Then commutativity says $$\alpha_A(r \circ \ell) = \ell$$.
But $$\ell$$ was *defined* to be the image of $$1_A$$ under the bijection $$\alpha_A$$, so $$r \circ \ell = 1_A$$.

Let's look now at the naturality diagram with respect to this map $$r$$:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e4-1-27_3.svg" width="350px"/></div>

where we've swapped the vertical arrows with their inverses, for convenience.
If we evaluate *this* diagram at $$\ell$$:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e4-1-27_4.svg" width="300px"/></div>

we get $$\alpha_{A'}^{-1}(\ell \circ r) = r$$.
But $$r$$ was defined to be the preimage of $$1_{A'}$$ under $$\alpha_{A'}$$, so we have $$\ell \circ r = 1_{A'}$$.

Then, $$\ell$$ (or $$r$$) is the desired isomorphism between $$A$$ and $$A'$$.
