title: Exercise 5.1.34
---


Let $$X \xrightarrow{f,g} Y$$ be a diagram in some category and $$(E, i : E  \rightarrow X)$$ be an equalizer of $$f$$ and $$g$$.
We can form an associated diagram:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-34_1.svg" width="150px"/></div>

which commutes.
Indeed, $$(E, i, i)$$ is a cone over the diagram $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{g} X$$, which follows only from the fact that $$(E, i)$$ is a cone over the parallel pair $$X \xrightarrow{f,g} Y$$.
However, $$(E, i, i)$$ is *not* necessarily a limit cone and thus a pullback.
We can see this by working in $$\mathbf{Set}$$.
Let $$X = \mathbb{Z}_4$$ and $$Y = \mathbb{Z}_2$$.
Let $$f$$ be the non-trivial (group) homomorphism between them and $$g$$ the trivial homomorphism.
Intuitively, we should not expect the square to be a pullback, because the equalizer of $$f$$ and $$g$$ should be the subgroup $$\set{0, 2}$$, while the pullback of the aforementioned diagram should be $$\set{0, 2} \times \set{0, 2}$$.
But, let's suppose $$E$$ was the equalizer $$\set{0, 2}$$, and demonstrate a counterexample to the square being a pullback.
Simply take the cone consisting of the singleton and maps picking out the elements $$0$$ and $$2$$.
It is a cone, because:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-34_2.svg" width="150px"/></div>

clearly commutes.
But we have:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-34_3.svg" width="300px"/></div>

but there can be no map $$\varphi$$: there are only two possible maps.
The map picking out $$0$$ makes the left triangle commute but not the top, and the map picking out $$2$$ makes the top triangle commute but not the left.
Thus, $$\set{0,2}$$ cannot be a pullback because we've demonstrated a distinct cone without a viable map making the diagram commute.

In fact, the argument works in general.
Take any cone $$(F, j, k)$$ over the diagram $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{g} X$$, such that $$j$$ and $$k$$ are *distinct*, and consider:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-34_4.svg" width="300px"/></div>

Since $$(F, j)$$ is a cone over $$X \xrightarrow{f,g} Y$$, we have a *unique* map $$\varphi_1 : F \rightarrow E$$ making the left triangle commute.
But, simultaneously, since $$(F, k)$$ is a distinct cone over the same parallel pair, we have a  distinct unique map $$\varphi_2 : F \rightarrow E$$ making the top triangle commute.
Even if both $$\varphi_1$$ and $$\varphi_2$$ made the entire diagram commute, they would be two non-equal such maps, meaning that $$E$$ fails to be a pullback.

However, the converse is true:

**Theorem**:
If $$(E, i, i)$$ is a pullback of the diagram $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{g} X$$, then $$(E, i)$$ is an equalizer of $$X \xrightarrow{f,g} Y$$.


*Proof*:
Take $$(F, j)$$ an arbitrary cone over $$X \xrightarrow{f,g} Y$$.
It follows immediately that $$(F, j, j)$$ is a cone over $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{g} X$$.
Then we have a unique $$\varphi$$ with:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-34_5.svg" width="300px"/></div>

commuting.
Then $$\varphi$$ is also the unique map making the left and top (identical) triangles commute.
But a unique $$\varphi$$ along with the left or top commuting triangle are exactly the items needed for $$(E, i)$$ to be an equalizer.
