**Theorem**:
Let $$\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\mathbf{B}$$ be categories, $$F,G : \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$$ functors and $$\alpha : F \rightarrow G$$ a natural transformation.
$$\alpha$$ is a natural isomorphism if and only if $$\alpha_A : FA \rightarrow GA$$ is an isomorphism (in $$\mathbf{B}$$) for each $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$.


*Proof*:
Suppose $$\alpha$$ is a natural isomorphism.
That is to say, it is an isomorphism between $$F$$ and $$G$$ in the category $$[\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}]$$.
Then, we have a natural transformation $$\beta : G \rightarrow F$$ so that $$\beta \alpha = 1_F$$ and $$\alpha \beta = 1_G$$ (the identity natural transformations on $$F$$ and $$G$$, respectively).
Recall $$\alpha$$ is a collection of arrows $$\alpha_A : FA \rightarrow GA$$ in $$\mathbf{B}$$ for each $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$.
And, by definition, they compose "component-wise", so that $$(\beta \alpha)_A = \beta_A \circ \alpha_A$$ for each $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$.
Then, clearly we have $$(1_F)_A = \beta_A \circ \alpha_A$$, but $$(1_F)_A$$ is, by definition, precisely the identity on $$FA$$ -- that is, $$1_{FA}$$.
Simultaneously, we have $$1_{GA} = (1_G)_A = \alpha_A \circ \beta_A$$.
These identities directly state that $$\alpha_A$$ (and $$\beta_A$$) are isomorphisms between $$FA$$ and $$GA$$.

Suppose that, for each $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$, $$\alpha_A : FA \rightarrow GA$$ is an isomorphism.
Then, also for each $$A$$ we have an arrow $$\beta_A : GA \rightarrow FA$$ with $$\beta_A \circ \alpha_A = 1_{FA}$$ and $$\alpha_A \circ \beta_A = 1_{GA}$$.
The identity natural transformation $$1_F$$ is defined so that $$(1_F)_A = 1_{FA}$$ for each $$A$$.
So we have $$(1_F)_A = \beta_A \circ \alpha_A$$ for each $$A$$, which means that $$\beta \circ \alpha = 1_F$$.
Similarly, we obtain $$\alpha \circ \beta = 1_G$$, and $$\alpha$$ (and $$\beta$$) are natural isomorphisms.
