description: If $$X, Y$$ are presheaves with $$\Hom(\dash, A) \cong X + Y$$, then either $$X$$ or $$Y$$ is trivial
---


**Theorem**:
For a locally small category $$\mathscr{A}$$ and $$A \in \mathscr{A}$$, if $$X, Y$$ are presheaves with $$H_A \cong X + Y$$, then either $$X$$ or $$Y$$ is the trivial presheaf $$\Delta \varnothing$$.


*Proof*:
A natural isomorphism $$H_A \cong X + Y$$ amounts to a universal element $$u \in (X+Y)(A) \cong X(A) + Y(A)$$.
Take an arbitrary $$B \in \mathscr{A}$$ and $$b \in (X+Y)(B) \cong X(B) + Y(B)$$.
Universality says we have a unique map $$\varphi: B \rightarrow A$$ with $$(X+Y)(\varphi)(u) = b$$.

Now either $$u \in X(A)$$ or $$u \in Y(A)$$.
Suppose that it is in $$X(A)$$.
Then for *any* map $$f : B \rightarrow A$$ we have:

$$
(X+Y)(f)(u) = (X(f) + Y(f))(u) = X(f)(u)
$$

from the behavior of sums of maps in $$\mathbf{Set}$$.
But, this means that $$(X+Y)(f)(u)$$ is always in $$X(B)$$.
Thus, if we picked a $$b \in Y(B)$$, there would be *no* map whose image under $$X+Y$$ carried $$u$$ to $$b$$, violating universality -- thus, there must be no elements in $$Y(B)$$.
Since $$B$$ was arbitrary, we have $$Y(B) = \varnothing$$ for all $$B$$ -- i.e., $$Y$$ is the constant presheaf $$\Delta \varnothing$$.

Supposing $$u \in Y(A)$$ and using a symmetric argument shows that $$X = \Delta \varnothing$$.
Thus, one of $$X$$ or $$Y$$ must be the trivial presheaf.
