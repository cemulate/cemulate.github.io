A map $$m : A \rightarrow B$$ is \textit{regular monic} if $$(A, m)$$ is an equalizer of some parallel pair $$B \rightrightarrows C$$.
$$m$$ is \textit{split monic} if it admits a left inverse, i.e. a map $$f$$ with $$fm = 1_A$$.

**Theorem**:
Split monic $$\Rightarrow$$ regular monic $$\Rightarrow$$ monic


*Proof*:
Assume $$m$$ is split monic, and let $$n$$ be its left inverse.
Then, take the parallel pair $$(\id, m \circ n) : B \rightarrow B$$.
We claim $$m$$ is the equalizer of this parallel pair.
Note that it is certainly a cone, since $$m \circ n \circ m = m \circ \id = m$$.
Suppose that $$(A', m')$$ were another cone such that $$m' = m \circ n \circ m'$$.
Define $$\varphi : A' \rightarrow A$$ as $$\varphi = n \circ m'$$.
Then certainly the appropriate triangle commutes: $$m \circ \varphi = m \circ n \circ m' = m'$$.
Suppose $$\phi$$ were another such map, so that $$m \circ \phi = m'$$.
But composing on the left by $$n$$ implies that $$n \circ m \circ \phi = n \circ m'$$ and then $$\phi = n \circ m' = \varphi$$.
So, $$\varphi$$ is unique and $$(A, m)$$ is the equalizer of the parallel pair, making $$m$$ regular monic.

Suppose $$m$$ is regular monic, and that it is the equalizer of $$B \xrightarrow{f,g} C$$.
Take arbitrary maps $$s, t: A' \rightarrow A$$ with $$m \circ s = m \circ t$$.
Then, of course, since $$(A', m \circ s)$$ and $$(A', m \circ t)$$ are (the same) cone over $$B \xrightarrow{f,g} C$$, we have a unique map $$\varphi : A' \rightarrow A$$ with $$m \circ \varphi = m \circ s = m \circ t$$.
Taking $$\varphi = s$$ and $$\varphi = t$$ make this true, so we must have $$\varphi = s = t$$.
So $$m$$ is monic.


An example of a monic which is not split occurs in $$\mathbf{Ab}$$.
Consider the inclusion $$i : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$$.
Being inclusion, it's clearly monic.
However, its a simple exercise in group theory to show there are no group homomorphisms from $$\mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$$ in general, so there can certainly be no left inverse, so $$i$$ is not split monic.
