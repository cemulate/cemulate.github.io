description: category with products and equalizers has all limits; existence theorem for limits proof
---


**Theorem**:
Let $$\mathbf{A}$$ be category having all products and equalizers.
Then $$\mathbf{A}$$ has all limits.


*Proof*:
Let $$D : \mathbf{I} \rightarrow \mathbf{A}$$ be a diagram.
We can define the following objects in $$\mathbf{A}$$:

$$
O = \prod_{I \in \text{Ob}(\mathbf{I})} D(I) \qquad M = \prod_{u : J \rightarrow K \in \text{Mor}(\mathbf{I})} D(K)
$$

Now we define maps $$s, t : O \rightarrow M$$.
$$O$$ is a product, and as such it comes with its projection maps $$(\pi_I : O \rightarrow D(I))_{I \in \mathbf{I}}$$.
Likewise $$M$$ comes equipped with projections $$\pi_u : M \rightarrow D(K)$$ for each map $$u : J \rightarrow K$$.
For any given $$u : J \rightarrow K$$, define a map $$s_u: O \rightarrow D(K)$$ by $$s_u = Du \circ \pi_J$$.
Define $$t_u : O \rightarrow D(K)$$ by $$t_u = \pi_K$$.
Finally, let $$s$$ be the unique morphism $$O \rightarrow M$$ such that $$\pi_u \circ s = s_u$$ for all morphisms $$u$$, and similarly for $$t$$.

Now, let $$L \xrightarrow{p} O$$ be the equalizer of $$s$$ and $$t$$.
Write $$p_I = \pi_I \circ p$$.
We claim that $$\left( L \xrightarrow{p_I} D(I) \right)_{I \in \mathbf{I}}$$ is precisely a limit cone over the whole diagram $$D$$.

First, let's verify that it is in fact a cone over $$D$$.
Given $$u : J \rightarrow K$$ we require $$D(u) \circ p_J = p_K$$, or $$D(u) \circ \pi_J \circ p = p_K$$.
Indeed, observe that $$D(u) \circ \pi_J = s_u = \pi_u \circ s$$, and then $$\pi_u \circ s \circ p = \pi_u \circ t \circ p$$ since $$p$$ is an equalizer.
Finally, $$\pi_u \circ t = t_u = \pi_K$$, and $$\pi_K \circ p = p_K$$, giving the desired equality.

To show it unique, let $$\left( A \xrightarrow{f_I} D(I) \right)_{I \in \mathbf{I}}$$ be an arbitrary cone over $$D$$.
There is a unique map $$\varphi : A \rightarrow O$$ such that $$\pi_I \circ \varphi = f_I$$.
We claim that $$s \circ \varphi = t \circ \varphi$$.
Indeed, consider that for some $$u : J \rightarrow K$$, we have $$\pi_u \circ s \circ \varphi = s_u \circ \varphi = D(u) \circ \pi_J \circ \varphi = D(u) \circ f_J = f_K$$.
Meanwhile, $$\pi_u \circ t \circ \varphi = t_u \circ \varphi = \pi_K \circ \varphi = f_K$$.
Since $$\pi_u \circ (s \circ \varphi) = \pi_u \circ (t \circ \varphi)$$ for all $$u$$, we have $$s \circ \varphi = t \circ \varphi$$.
Then since $$A$$ equalizes $$s$$ and $$t$$, we have a unique map $$\phi : A \rightarrow L$$ with $$p_I \circ \phi = f_I$$.
This is the desired unique map, making $$L$$ the limit of the diagram $$D$$.
