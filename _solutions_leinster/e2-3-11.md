**Theorem**:
Let $$U : \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$ have a left-adjoint $$F \dashv U$$.
Suppose that for at least one $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$, $$U(A)$$ has more than one element.
Then for each $$S$$, the unit $$\eta_S : S \rightarrow UF(S)$$ is an injective map of sets.


*Proof*:
We will first establish that, under the given hypothesis, $$F$$ must be faithful.
To see this, suppose we have $$g, h: S \rightarrow T$$ such that $$g \neq h$$.
The goal is to show that $$F(g) \neq F(h)$$.
Indeed, if $$g \neq h$$, there exists some $$x \in S$$ such that $$g(x) \neq h(x)$$.
Now, let $$A \in \mathbf{A}$$ be such that $$\abs{U(A)} > 1$$, and let $$a, b \in U(A)$$ be elements.
Define $$f : T \rightarrow U(A)$$ with the property $$f(g(x)) = a$$ and $$f(h(x)) = b$$.
Then, clearly, $$f \circ g \neq f \circ h$$.
But, $$f \circ g, f \circ h : S \rightarrow U(A)$$ each have a transpose $$F(S) \rightarrow A$$.
In particular, that transpose can be given explicitly as:

$$
\overline{f \circ g} = \varepsilon_A \circ F(f \circ g) = \varepsilon_A \circ F(f) \circ F(g) = \overline{f} \circ F(g)
$$

and similarly $$\overline{f \circ h} = \overline{f} \circ F(h)$$.
Since $$f \circ g \neq f \circ h$$, their transposes are not equal either, and $$\overline{f} \circ F(g) \neq \overline{f} \circ F(h)$$, which means $$F(g) \neq F(h)$$.
So $$F$$ is faithful.

We now show that faithfulness of $$F$$ implies the desired property of the unit.
Fix an $$S \in \mathbf{Set}$$.
Saying that $$\eta_S$$ is injective amounts to saying that, for any $$g, h: S' \rightarrow S$$, $$\eta_S \circ g = \eta_S \circ h$$ implies $$g = h$$.
So, lets assume we have such a $$g$$ and $$h$$ with $$\eta_S \circ g = \eta_S \circ h$$.
Note that $$\eta_S \circ g$$ is an arrow $$S' \rightarrow U(F(S))$$ in $$\mathbf{Set}$$, and as such it has a transpose $$\overline{\eta_S \circ g} : F(S') \rightarrow F(S)$$.
Furthermore, this transpose can be calculated explicitly as:

$$
\overline{\eta_S \circ g} = \varepsilon_{F(S)} \circ F(\eta_S \circ g) = \varepsilon_{F(S)} \circ F(\eta_S) \circ F(g) = F(g)
$$

where the last equality follows precisely due to the triangle identity, which says that $$\varepsilon_{F(S)} \circ F(\eta_S) = 1_{F(S)}$$.
Similarly we obtain $$\overline{\eta_S \circ h} = F(h)$$.
Then, since $$\eta_S \circ g = \eta_S \circ h$$, their transposes are equal, and we have $$F(g) = F(h)$$.
Since $$F$$ is faithful, we have $$g = h$$.
So, $$\eta_S$$ is injective.
