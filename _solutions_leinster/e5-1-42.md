description: A pullback of a monic map is monic
---


Let

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-42_1.svg" width="250px"/></div>

be a pullback square.

**Theorem**:
If $$m$$ is monic, so is $$m'$$.


*Proof*:
Let $$h, h' : Z \rightarrow X'$$ be maps with $$m' \circ h = m' \circ h'$$.
Since the square above commutes, we have $$m \circ f' = f \circ m'$$, and thus $$m \circ f' \circ h = f \circ m' \circ h$$.
Thus, $$(Z, m' \circ h, f' \circ h)$$ is a cone over $$A' \xrightarrow{f} A \xleftarrow{m} X$$.
Thus, we have a unique $$\varphi : Z \rightarrow X'$$ with (1) $$m' \circ \varphi = m' \circ h$$, and (2) $$f' \circ \varphi = f' \circ h$$.
Taking $$\varphi = h$$ trivially makes both statements true.
$$\varphi = h'$$ makes (1) true by supposition.
To see that it satisfies (2) as well, consider the following:
Since $$m' \circ h = m' \circ h'$$, it follows that $$f \circ m' \circ h = f \circ m' \circ h'$$.
But $$f \circ m' = m \circ f'$$, and we have $$m \circ f' \circ h = m \circ f' \circ h'$$.
Finally, since $$m$$ is monic we have $$f' \circ h = f' \circ h'$$, so $$\varphi = h'$$ indeed makes (2) true.
Since $$\varphi$$ is unique, we must have $$\varphi = h = h'$$, so $$m'$$ is monic.
