$$

**Theorem**:
Let $$M : \mathbf{Cat} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$ be the functor sending a small category to the set of all its maps.
$$M$$ is representable.


*Proof*:
Denote by $$\mathbf{2}$$ the category with two objects and one non-identity arrow between them.
We will denote the objects by $$\circ$$ and $$*$$ and the map by $$m : \circ \rightarrow *$$.
We claim $$M \cong \twohom{\dash}$$.
Indeed, we define a natural transformation $$\alpha : M \rightarrow \twohom{\dash}$$.
For a category $$\mathbf{A}$$, define $$\alpha_{\mathbf{A}} : M(\mathbf{A}) \rightarrow \twohom{\mathbf{A}}$$ as follows.
For a map $$f : A \rightarrow A'$$ in $$\mathbf{A}$$, let $$\alpha_{\mathbf{A}}(f)$$ be the obvious functor sending $$\circ$$ to $$A$$, $$*$$ to $$A'$$, and the $$m$$ to $$f$$.
To check naturality, suppose we have a functor $$F : \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$$.
We must have $$\alpha_{\mathbf{B}} \circ M(F) = \twohom{F} \circ \alpha_{\mathbf{A}}$$.
Note that $$M(F)$$ is essentially $$F$$ (the restriction of $$F$$ to the maps of the category), and $$\twohom{F}$$ is left-composition by $$F$$.
Start with a map $$f : A \rightarrow A'$$ in $$\mathbf{A}$$.
It's straightforward to see that applying the left and right side result in the same functor $$\mathbf{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{B}$$.
Applying the right side to $$f$$ yields:

$$
f \enspace \mapsto \enspace
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\circ \mapsto A \\
* \mapsto A' \\
m \mapsto f
\end{array} \right.
\enspace \mapsto \enspace
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\circ \mapsto F(A) \\
* \mapsto F(A') \\
m \mapsto F(f)
\end{array} \right.
$$

while applying the left side to $$f$$ yields:

$$
f \enspace \mapsto \enspace  F(f) : F(A) \rightarrow F(A') \enspace \mapsto \enspace
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\circ \mapsto F(A) \\
* \mapsto F(A') \\
m \mapsto F(f)
\end{array} \right.
$$

so $$\alpha$$ is natural and $$M \cong \twohom{\dash}$$.
