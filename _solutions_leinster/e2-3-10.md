**Theorem**:
Let $$F : \mathbf{A} \leftrightharpoons \mathbf{B} : G$$ be functors and $$\eta : 1_{\mathbf{A}} \rightarrow GF$$, $$\varepsilon : FG \rightarrow 1_{\mathbf{B}}$$ natural *isomorphisms* such that we have an equivalence of categories between $$\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\mathbf{B}$$.
Then $$F$$ is left adjoint to $$G$$.


*Proof*:
$$\eta$$ and $$\varepsilon$$ are certainly natural transformations, but they may not satisfy the triangle identities.
In particular, we may have that $$\varepsilon F \circ F \eta \neq \id_F$$.
Define a new natural transformation $$\varepsilon' : FG \rightarrow 1_{\mathbf{B}}$$.
We will let $$\varepsilon' = \varepsilon \circ F \eta^{-1} G \circ FG \varepsilon^{-1}$$.
Note that since $$\eta$$ and $$\epsilon$$ are natural isomorphisms, so is each member of the composition and thus $$\varepsilon'$$ as well.
We claim that $$\varepsilon' F \circ F\eta = \id_F$$.
Or, expanding out, that $$\varepsilon F \circ F \eta^{-1} G F \circ FG \varepsilon^{-1} F \circ F \eta = \id_F$$.
Let $$A$$ be arbitrary and examine the component of the left-hand side at $$A$$:

$$
FA \xrightarrow{F(\eta_A)} FGFA \xrightarrow{FG(\varepsilon^{-1}_{FA})} FGFGFA \xrightarrow{F(\eta^{-1}_{GFA})} FGFA \xrightarrow{\varepsilon_{FA}} FA
$$

we want this to be equal to $$1_{FA}$$.

First, we write down some commutative diagrams that give some useful identities about the components of $$\eta$$ and $$\varepsilon$$ that depend on the fact that they are isomorphisms.
First, note that this square commutes:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e2-3-10_1.svg" width="300px"/></div>

since is is the statement of the naturality requirement for the natural isomorphism $$\eta : 1 \rightarrow GF$$ with respect to the arrow $$\eta_A : A \rightarrow GFA$$.
This diagram states that $$\eta_{GFA} \circ \eta_A = GF(\eta_A) \circ \eta_A$$.
Since $$\eta_A$$ is an isomorphism, we can compose on the right by $$\eta_A^{-1}$$ to get

$$
\eta_{GFA} = GF(\eta_A)
$$

Pull the dual trick with $$\varepsilon$$.
That is, since this diagram commutes:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e2-3-10_2.svg" width="300px"/></div>

we can say that $$\varepsilon_B \circ FG(\varepsilon_B) = \varepsilon_B \circ \varepsilon_{FGB}$$, and left-cancel to get:

$$
FG(\varepsilon_B) = \varepsilon_{FGB}
$$


Now, we write down *another* commutative diagram:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e2-3-10_3.svg" width="300px"/></div>

This one commutes because it is precisely the statement of the naturality for the natural isomorphism $$\varepsilon^{-1} : 1 \rightarrow FG$$ with respect to the arrow $$F(\eta_A) : FA \rightarrow FGFA$$.
Applying the identities we just derived (keeping in mind they also work for the inverses of $$\eta$$ and $$\varepsilon$$), we can rewrite the right and bottom arrows.

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e2-3-10_4.svg" width="300px"/></div>

\textit{Finally}, note that the bottom arrow is an isomorphism and has an inverse $$F(\eta_{GFA})^{-1} = F(\eta^{-1}_{GFA})$$.
With this, simply attach an $$\varepsilon_{FA} : FGFA \rightarrow FA$$ to the bottom of the diagram to get the final commuting diagram:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e2-3-10_5.svg" width="300px"/></div>

Following the diagram right, down, left, and down gives exactly the composite in question from earlier.
But, following the left side straight down gives $$\varepsilon_{FA} \circ \varepsilon^{-1}_{FA} = 1_{FA}$$.
Since the diagram commutes, we have the desired equality.

So, $$\eta$$ and $$\varepsilon'$$ are natural isomorphisms satisfying the triangle inequalities.
So $$F \dashv G$$ with unit $$\eta$$ and counit $$\varepsilon'$$.
