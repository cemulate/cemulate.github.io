**Theorem**:
A map $$f : X \rightarrow Y$$ is monic if and only if the square:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-41_1.svg" width="250px"/></div>

is a pullback.


*Proof*:
Assume the square is a pullback.
Let $$g, g' : A \rightarrow X$$ be maps with $$f \circ g = f \circ g'$$.
Then $$(A, g, g')$$ is a cone over $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{f} X$$.
Thus, we have a unique $$\varphi : A \rightarrow X$$ with $$1 \circ \varphi = g$$ and $$1 \circ \varphi = g'$$, so $$\varphi = g = g'$$.

Assume $$f$$ is monic.
Let $$(A, g, g')$$ be an arbitrary cone over $$X \xrightarrow{f} Y \xleftarrow{f} X$$.
We need a unique $$\varphi$$ such that:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e5-1-41_2.svg" width="250px"/></div>

commutes.
Note that since $$(A, g, g')$$ is a cone, we have $$f \circ g = f \circ g'$$ and since $$f$$ is monic, $$g = g'$$.
Thus, taking $$\varphi = g = g'$$ makes the diagram commute.
Clearly then, this is the unique such map, because if any other $$\varphi = h$$ made the diagram commute, we would have $$h = g = g'$$.
