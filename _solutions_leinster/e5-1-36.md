description: Limit cones over a diagram are in correspondence with maps into the limit object
---


Let $$D : \mathbf{I} \rightarrow \mathbf{A}$$ be a diagram and $$\left( L \xrightarrow{p_I} D(I) \right)_{I \in \mathbf{I}}$$ a limit cone over $$D$$.

**Theorem**:
If $$A \xrightarrow{h,h'} L$$ are maps such that $$p_I \circ h = p_I \circ h'$$ for all $$I \in \mathbf{I}$$, then $$h = h'$$.


*Proof*:
Consider that $$\left( A \xrightarrow{p_I \circ h} D(I) \right)_{I \in \mathbf{I}}$$ is a cone over $$D$$.
Then, there is a unique map $$f : A \rightarrow L$$ such that $$p_I \circ f = p_I \circ h$$.
Taking $$f = h$$ and $$f = h'$$ both make this equality true (the former trivially and the latter by supposition), so we must have $$f = h = h'$$ since $$f$$ is unique.

$$\mjqed$$

Consider the case where $$\mathbf{I}$$ is the two-object discrete category, $$\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Set}$$, and $$A = \set{*}$$.
Interpreting the theorem above in this setting amounts to choosing a pair of sets $$S, T$$, and two elements of their product $$L = S \times T$$.
The theorem then says that if two elements of $$S \times T$$ have the same left entry and right entry, then the two elements are equal as tuples -- in other words, equality of tuples is equivalent to component-wise equality.
