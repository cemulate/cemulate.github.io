$$

For $$p$$ prime, let $$U_p : \mathbf{Grp} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$ be a functor sending a a group $$G$$ to its set of elements having order $$1$$ or $$p$$.
For a group homomorphism $$f : G \rightarrow H$$, simply let $$U_p(f)$$ be the restriction of $$f$$ to $$U_p(G)$$ -- this is well defined since $$p$$ is prime, and thus $$f$$ necessarily sends an element of order $$p$$ to an element of order $$1$$ or $$p$$.

**Theorem**:
$$U_p$$ is representable.
In particular, $$U_p$$ is isomorophic to $$\mathbf{Grp}(\mathbb{Z}_p, \dash)$$.


*Proof*:
Define a natural transformation $$\alpha : U_p \rightarrow \zphom$$ as follows.
For a group $$G$$, let $$\alpha_G : U_p(G) \rightarrow \zphoma{G}$$ send an element $$g$$ of order $$1$$ or $$p$$ to the unique homomorphism $$\varphi : \mathbb{Z}_p \rightarrow G$$ such that $$\varphi(1) = g$$.
In other words, $$\varphi$$ is the map $$n \mapsto g^n$$.
We now check naturality.
Suppose $$f : G \rightarrow H$$ is a homomorphism.
We must have $$\alpha_H \circ U_p(f) = \zphoma{f} \circ \alpha_G : U_p(G) \rightarrow \zphoma{H}$$.
Recall that $$\zphoma{f}$$ is just left-composition by $$f$$.
Take a $$g$$ in $$U_p(G)$$.
On the right side, we have $$\alpha_G(g) = n \mapsto g^n$$, then left-composing with $$f$$ yields $$f \circ (n \mapsto g^n) = n \mapsto f(g^n) = n \mapsto f(g)^n$$.
On the left, we have $$U_p(f)(g) = f(g)$$.
Then, $$\alpha_H(f(g)) = n \mapsto f(g)^n$$.
So both sides yield the same map $$\mathbb{Z}_p \rightarrow H$$, verifying that $$\alpha$$ is natural.
So $$U_p \cong \zphoma{\dash}$$.
