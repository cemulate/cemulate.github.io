description: Slice of a presheaf category is equivalent to presheaves on the category of elements
---


**Theorem**:
Every slice of a presheaf category is equivalent to another presheaf category.
In particular, if $$X \in \presheaves{\mathbf{A}}$$, then

$$
\presheaves{\mathbf{A}} / X \equiv \presheaves{\mathbf{E}(X)}
$$

where $$\mathbf{E}(X)$$ is the category of elements of $$X$$.


*Proof*:
We will define a functor $$F : \presheaves{\mathbf{A}} / X \rightarrow \presheaves{\mathbf{E}(X)}$$.
Take a pair $$(R, \eta : R \rightarrow X) \in \presheaves{\mathbf{A}} / X$$.
$$F(R, \eta)$$ is a contravariant functor $$\mathbf{E}(X) \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$.
Given an $$(A, a) \in \mathbf{E}(X)$$, we let $$F(R, \eta)(A, a) = \eta_A^*(a)$$ -- that is, the inverse image of $$\set{a}$$ under $$\eta_A$$.
On a map $$f : (A, a) \rightarrow (A', a')$$ let $$F(R, \eta)(f) : \eta_{A'}^*(a') \rightarrow \eta_A^*(a)$$ simply be the restriction $$R(f) \upharpoonright \eta_{A'}^*(a')$$.
Consider a map $$\alpha : (R, \eta) \rightarrow (S, \varepsilon)$$ in $$\presheaves{\mathbf{A}} / X$$; that is $$\alpha : R \rightarrow S$$ with $$\varepsilon \circ \alpha = \eta$$.
$$F(\alpha)$$ is a natural transformation $$F(R, \eta) \rightarrow F(S, \varepsilon)$$ with components $$F(\alpha)_{(A, a)} : \eta_A^*(a) \rightarrow \varepsilon_A^*(a)$$.
Simply let $$F(\alpha)_{(A, a)} = \alpha_A \upharpoonright \eta_A^*(a)$$, again the restriction.
This is well defined -- notice that if $$k \in \eta_A^*(a)$$, then $$\eta_A(k) = a$$, thus $$(\varepsilon_A \circ \alpha_A)(k) = a$$, and thus $$k \in \varepsilon_A^*(a)$$.
Naturality is also easy to verify -- since components of $$F(\alpha)$$ are just restrictions of components of $$\alpha$$, the appropriate squares still commute.

We claim that $$F$$ is full, faithful, and essentially surjective, making it an equivalence.
Let $$(R, \eta), (S, \varepsilon) \in \presheaves{\mathbf{A}}/X$$.
Suppose we have maps $$\alpha, \beta : (R, \eta) \rightarrow (S, \varepsilon)$$ such that $$F(\alpha) = F(\beta)$$.
This means that $$F(\alpha)_{(A, a)} = F(\beta)_{(A, a)}$$ for all $$(A, a) \in \mathbf{E}(X)$$.
Then $$\alpha_A$$ and $$\beta_A$$ are equal when restricted to $$\eta_A^*(a)$$, for all $$a$$.
But for every $$A$$, $$R(A) = \bigsqcup_{a \in X(A)} \eta_A^*(a)$$, so we must have that $$\alpha_A$$ and $$\beta_A$$ are equal on all of $$R(A)$$ -- thus $$\alpha_A = \beta_A$$ for all $$A$$ and $$\alpha = \beta$$.
Thus $$F$$ is faithful.

Suppose that $$\gamma$$ is some natural transformation $$F(R, \eta) \rightarrow F(S, \varepsilon)$$, having components $$\gamma_{(A, a)} : \eta_A^*(a) \rightarrow \varepsilon_A^*(a)$$.
Consider each $$\gamma_{(A, a)}$$ as a map $$\eta_A^*(a) \rightarrow S(A)$$.
Again since $$R(A) = \bigsqcup_{a \in X(A)} \eta_A^*(a)$$, we have the unique map $$\alpha_A = \bigsqcup_{a \in X(A)} \gamma_{(A, a)} : R(A) \rightarrow S(A)$$.
Indeed, these $$\alpha_A$$'s form the components of a natural transformation $$\alpha : R \rightarrow S$$.
To verify naturality, let $$f : A \rightarrow A'$$ be an arrow.
We want the following to commute:

Indeed, for every $$a' \in X(A')$$, we can form the diagram given by restricting each side of the above diagram:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e6-2-24_2.svg" width="450"/></div>

which is actually equivalent to

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e6-2-24_3.svg" width="400"/></div>

which commutes precisely because $$\gamma$$ is natural.
Since every such restriction diagram commutes, the previous diagram does as well.
Finally, it's clear that $$F(\alpha)_{(A, a)} = \gamma_{(A, a)}$$ and $$F(\alpha) = \gamma$$.
So, $$F$$ is full.

Finally, let's show $$F$$ is essentially surjective.
Let $$Z \in \presheaves{\mathbf{E}(X)}$$ be a presheaf.
We first define a presheaf $$G \in \presheaves{\mathbf{A}}$$.
Let $$G(A) = \bigsqcup_{a \in X(A)} Z(A, a)$$.
For a map $$f: A \rightarrow A'$$, let $$G(f) = \bigsqcup_{a' \in X(A')} Z(f)$$, where $$f$$ is being considered as a map $$(A, X(f)(a')) \rightarrow (A', a')$$.
We now need a natural transformation $$\tau : G \rightarrow X$$.
Let $$\tau_A : G(A) \rightarrow X(A)$$ be the natural projection sending a member of $$G(A)$$ to its index in the sum.
To check naturality, we need the following to commute for an $$f : A \rightarrow A'$$:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e6-2-24_4.svg" width="250"/></div>

but if we restrict to a single $$a' \in X(A')$$ the constituent part of the diagram becomes:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e6-2-24_5.svg" width="400"/></div>

which trivially commutes (since $$\tau_A$$ and $$\tau_{A'}$$ are the natural projections).
Since the objects and arrows in the whole diagrams are all disjoint unions of these parts, the whole diagram commutes.
Finally, we calculate $$F(G, \tau)$$.
Recall that $$F(G, \tau)(A, a) = \tau_A^*(a)$$, which is precisely (a subset canonically isomorphic to) $$Z(A, a)$$.
So $$F(G, \tau)(A, a) \cong Z(A, a)$$, and its easily checked that this isomorphism is natural (essentially because it is canonical).

Finally then, $$F$$ is full, faithful, and essentially surjective on objects making it an equivalence.
