**Theorem**:
Fix a small category $$\mathbf{A}$$.
Let $$\mathscr{S}$$ be a locally small category with pullbacks.
For functors $$X, Y: \mathbf{A} \rightarrow \mathscr{S}$$, a natural transformation $$\alpha : X \rightarrow Y$$ is monic in $$[\mathbf{A}, \mathscr{S}]$$ if and only if $$\alpha_A$$ is monic for all $$A$$.


*Proof*:
Suppose $$\alpha_A$$ is monic for all $$A$$.
Then, suppose we have $$\eta, \varepsilon : X' \rightarrow X$$ so that $$\alpha \circ \eta = \alpha \circ \varepsilon$$.
Then $$\alpha_A \circ \eta_A = \alpha_A \circ \varepsilon_A$$ for all $$A$$.
But then $$\eta_A = \varepsilon_A$$ for all $$A$$ and $$\eta = \varepsilon$$.
So $$\alpha$$ is monic.

Now suppose that $$\alpha$$ is monic as a map in $$[\mathbf{A}, \mathscr{S}]$$.
Then, the following square is a pullback:

The evaluation functor preserves limits, so we have that:

<div class="math-figure"><img src="/img/math_solutions/leinster/e6-2-20_2.svg" width="250"/></div>

is a pullback for each $$A$$.
Suppose we have maps $$f, g: J \rightarrow X(A)$$ with $$\alpha_A \circ f = \alpha_A \circ g$$.
Then $$(J, f, g)$$ is a cone over $$X(A) \xrightarrow{\alpha_A} Y(A) \xleftarrow{\alpha_A} X(A)$$.
But then the pullback square above implies that $$f = g$$, and $$\alpha_A$$ is monic.
