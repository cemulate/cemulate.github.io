\newcommand{\crhom}[1]{\mathbf{CRing}(\mathbb{Z}[X], #1)}
$$

**Theorem**:
The forgetful functor $$U : \mathbf{CRing} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$$ is representable.
In particular $$U \cong \crhom{\dash}$$.


*Proof*:
First, we establish the following fact.
For a commutative ring $$R$$ and element $$r \in R$$, define the \textit{evaluation map} $$e_r : \mathbb{Z}[X] \rightarrow R$$ by $$e(p(X)) = p(r)$$, the map that evaluates the given polynomial at $$r$$ inside $$R$$.
Note that $$e_r(X) = r$$.
This is indeed the *unique* homomorphism $$\mathbb{Z}[X] \rightarrow R$$ that sends $$X \mapsto r$$.
This is straightforward to see:
Suppose $$f : \mathbb{Z}[X] \rightarrow R$$ were a homomorphism with $$f(X) = r$$.
Let $$p(X) = \sum_0^kp_n X^n$$.
Then,

$$
f(p(X)) = f\left( \sum_0^k p_n X^n \right) = \sum_0^k p_n f(X)^n = \sum_0^k p_n r^n = e_r(p(X))
$$

and thus $$f = e_r$$.

The preceding fact is most of the content of the proof.
Indeed, define the natural transformation $$\alpha : U \rightarrow \crhom{\dash}$$ with components $$\alpha_R : U(R) \rightarrow \crhom{R}$$ taking an element $$r$$ to the map $$e_r$$.
We verify naturality:
Let $$f : R \rightarrow S$$ be a ring homomorphism.
We must have $$\alpha_S \circ U(f) = \crhom{f} \circ \alpha_R$$.
Again $$\crhom{f}$$ is just left-composition by $$f$$, and $$U(f)$$ is just $$f$$.
So, let $$r \in U(r)$$.
Applying the right side to $$r$$ yields $$f \circ e_r$$.
Applying the left side to $$r$$ yields $$e_{f(r)}$$.
But of course,

$$
e_{f(r)}\left( \sum_0^k p_n X^n \right) = \sum_0^k p_n f(r)^n = f \left( \sum_0^k p_n r^n \right) = f \left( e_r \left( \sum_0^k p_n X^n \right) \right)
$$

and $$e_{f(r)} = f \circ e_r$$.
So $$\alpha$$ is natural and $$U \cong \crhom{\dash}$$.
