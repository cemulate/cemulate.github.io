description: Two epics are isomorphic in $$\mathbf{Set}$$ when they induce the same equivalence relation
---


Denote by $$\mathbf{Epic}(A)$$ the full subcategory of $$\mathbf{A}/A$$ whose objects are the epic morphisms.
Call a "quotient object" of $$A$$ an isomorphism class of objects in $$\mathbf{Epic}(A)$$.

**Theorem**:
Let $$A \xrightarrow{e} X$$ and $$A \xrightarrow{e'} X'$$ be epics in $$\mathbf{Set}$$.
$$e$$ and $$e'$$ are isomorphic in $$\mathbf{Epic}(A)$$ if and only if they induce the same equivalence relation on $$A$$.


*Proof*:
Suppose $$e$$ and $$e'$$ are isomorphic in $$\mathbf{Epic}(A)$$.
This means there is an isomorphism $$f : X \rightarrow X'$$ such that $$f \circ e = e'$$.
Let $$R \subset A \times A$$ be the equivalence relation induced by $$e$$, similarly for $$R'$$.
Suppose that $$(s, t) \in R'$$.
In particular $$e'(s) = e'(t)$$.
Then, $$(f \circ e)(s) = (f \circ e)(t)$$.
Since $$f$$ is in particular injective, we have $$e(s) = e(t)$$.
So $$R' \subseteq R$$.
The converse follows similarly by noting that we have an isomorphism $$f^{-1}$$ and $$e = f^{-1} \circ e'$$.
So $$R = R'$$.

Suppose that $$R = R'$$.
Define a map $$f : X \rightarrow X'$$ as follows.
Given an $$x \in X$$, choose an $$a \in A$$ such that $$e(a) = x$$ (which must exist, since epics in $$\mathbf{Set}$$ are surjective), and let $$f(x) = e'(a)$$.
This is well defined because, if we were to choose a different element $$b$$ with $$f(b) = x$$, we have $$(a, b) \in R$$ so $$(a, b) \in R'$$ and $$e'(b) = e'(a)$$.
To see $$f$$ is injective, take $$x \neq x'$$.
Then we must have an $$a, b$$ with $$e(a) = x$$ and $$e(b) = x'$$ but $$(a, b) \not\in R$$ (if it were, $$e$$ would be identical on $$a$$ and $$b$$) -- it follows that $$(a,b) \not\in R'$$ so $$e'(a) \neq e'(b)$$, so $$f$$ takes distinct values.
It's easy to see that $$f$$ is surjective -- given an $$x' \in X'$$, take an $$a$$ with $$e'(a) = x'$$, and note that the element $$e(a)$$ maps onto $$x'$$.
So $$f$$ is a bijection and thus an isomorphism.
To check that it is an isomorphism in $$\mathbf{Epic}(A)$$, we must ensure that $$f \circ e = e'$$.
Indeed, given $$a \in A$$, $$(f \circ e)(a)$$ is equal to $$e'(b)$$ for some element $$b \in A$$ with $$(a, b) \in R$$.
But of course $$e'(b) = e'(a)$$ because $$(a, b) \in R'$$.
So, $$f$$ is indeed an isomorphism of epics.


So we have the dual result to that of 5.1.40 -- the "quotient objects" of $$A$$ are in correspondence with the equivalence relations on $$A$$.
