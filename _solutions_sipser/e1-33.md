Take $$\Sigma = \set{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}$$.




Write the function $$V(x)$$ to denote the value of a string $$x \in \set{0,1}^*$$ when taken as a binary number with most significant digit first.



If $$x = (a_1, b_1) (a_2, b_2) \dots (a_n, b_n)$$ let

$$
t(x) = V(a_1 a_2 \dots a_n) \quad b(x) = V(b_1 b_2 \dots b_n)
$$

Then consider the language $$L = \setbuilder{x \in \Sigma^*}{b(x) = 3 \cdot t(x)}$$, that is, the binary value of the concatenation of the right-hand numbers is three times that of the left hand numbers.

We build a DFA that accepts $$L^R$$, that is, strings satisfying the same numerical properties as above, but starting with the least significant digit.



First, suppose $$k = k_n k_{n-1} \dots k_1 k_0$$, i.e., a binary string with MSB first. Then,

$$
\begin{align*}
3V(k) &= 3(k_n 2^n + k_{n-1} 2^{n-1} + \dots + k_1 2^1 + k_0) \\
&= (2+1)(k_n 2^n + k_{n-1} 2^{n-1} + \dots + k_1 2^1 + k_0) \\
&= (k_n 2^{n+1} + k_{n-1} 2^{n} + \dots + k_0 2^1 + 0) + (k_n 2^n + k_{n-1} 2^{n-1} + \dots + k_1 2^1 + k_0)
\end{align*}
$$

So $$3V(k)$$ is $$k$$ added with a shifted copy of itself.
So, a naive way to express the condition that $$V(b) = 3V(a)$$ is:

$$
a_0 = b_0 \tand a_i + a_{i-1} = b_i \text{ for all } i
$$

Which is almost correct, but we need to account for carry.



Let $$x = (a_1, b_1) (a_2, b_2) \dots$$ be an input to our DFA.
Our machine will emulate a full adder.
That is, upon reading $$(a_i, b_i)$$, it will check that $$a_{i-1} + a_i = b_i$$ (mod 2), accounting for carry bit, and remember if a carry bit was introduced or used up in that addition.
This means we need to remember value of $$a_{i-1}$$ and whether or not there is currently a carry bit, which will require four states.
If ever $$a_{i-1} + a_i \neq b_i$$, the machine goes into a dead state.



Obviously, states with carry bits cannot be accepting, because the presence of a carry bit means that the addition is not 'complete' without writing down another 1.
In addition, if $$a_{i-1} = 1$$, the current value of $$3V(a)$$ would certainly require one more digit, so this state cannot be accepting either.
The only accepting state is $$a_{i-1} = 0$$ with no carry bit.



So let $$Q = \set{0, 1, 0^c, 1^c, D}$$. The number denotes the value of $$a_{i-1}$$ and superscript $$c$$ denotes the presence of a carry bit. $$D$$ is the dead state.
Then the following is a DFA $$M$$ that accepts $$L^R$$

Then $$L^R$$ is regular and $$L$$ is also regular (by 1.31).
