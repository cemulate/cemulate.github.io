**Theorem**: If $$A$$ is regular, then the language of left-halves of strings in A:

$$
A_h = \setbuilder{x}{\exists y \tst |x| = |y| \tand xy \in A}
$$

is also regular.

----

*Proof*:
Since $$A$$ is regular, there is a DFA $$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$$ accepting $$A$$.
Write the states as $$Q = \set{q_0, q_1, \dots, q_{n-1}}$$.
We construct an NFA $$M_h = (Q_h, \Sigma, \delta_h, q_{0h}, F_h)$$ as follows.



Take $$Q_h = Q^{n+1}$$, and $$q_{0h} = (q_0, q_0, q_1, \dots, q_{n-1})$$.
We maintain a 'prime' copy of the DFA $$M$$, which will start at $$q_0$$.
We then run $$n$$ other machines simultaneously.
Each of these machines starts at a different state from $$Q$$, and takes all possible transitions at each step.
Then an input string is accepted if and only if the 'prime' copy is in a state $$x$$ at the same time as the copy started from $$x$$ is in a final state.



So, we further define:

$$
\delta_h(q, x) = \set{\delta(q, x)} \times \underbrace{\bigcup_{y \in \Sigma} \set{\delta(q, y)} \times \dots \times \bigcup_{y \in \Sigma} \set{\delta(q, y)}}_{n \text{ times}}
$$

And finally,

$$
F_h = \setbuilder{(q_k, x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})}{x_k \in F}
$$

So this machine accepts $$A_h$$, and $$A_h$$ is regular.
