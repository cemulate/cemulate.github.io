Let $$\Sigma = \set{0, 1, +, =}$$ and

$$

ADD = \setbuilder{x=y+z}{x,y,z \in \set{0, 1}^* \text{ and the equation is 'correct' w.r.t. binary arithmetic}}
$$

This language is not regular.

*Proof*:
Suppose $$ADD$$ were regular and let $$p$$ be the pumping length.
Take $$z$$ to be the string $$1^{2p} = 1^p 0^p + 1^p$$, noting that $$z \in ADD$$ and $$|z| \geq p$$.
Then let $$z = uvw$$ such that $$|uv| \leq p$$ and $$|v| \geq 1$$.



We see that $$u$$ and $$v$$ consist entirely of $$1$$'s, that is, $$v = 1^k$$ for some $$k \geq 1$$.
But $$u v^0 w$$ is $$1^{(2p - k)} = 1^p 0^p + 1^p$$.
Looking at the right-hand side, the sum must have $$1$$ in the $$2p$$'th spot, so this equation cannot be correct, and this string is not in $$ADD$$, contradicting the pumping lemma.
So $$ADD$$ is not regular.
