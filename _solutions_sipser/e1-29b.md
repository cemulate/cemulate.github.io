**Theorem**: The language $$A = \setbuilder{www}{w \in \set{a, b}^*}$$ is not regular.

----

*Proof*:
Suppose $$A$$ were regular and let $$p$$ be the constant guaranteed by the pumping lemma.
Take $$z = a^p b^p a^p b^p a^p b^p$$, noting that $$z \in A$$ and $$|z| \geq p$$.
Then let $$z = uvw$$ such that $$|uv| \leq p$$ and $$|v| \geq 1$$.



Because $$|uv| \leq p$$, and $$uv$$ is a prefix of $$z$$, it must be the case that $$u$$ and $$v$$ consist entirely of $$a$$'s.
In particular, $$v = a^k$$ for some $$k \geq 1$$.
But then $$u v^0 w = a^{(p-k)} b^p a^p b^p a^p b^p$$, which is not in $$A$$, contradicting the pumping lemma, so $$A$$ is not regular.
