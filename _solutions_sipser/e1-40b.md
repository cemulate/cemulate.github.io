description: If $$A$$ is regular, then the language of words that are not proper prefixes of words in $$A$$ is also regular
---


Let $$A$$ be a language over $$\Sigma$$ and let:

$$
NE(A) = \setbuilder{w \in A}{w \text{ is not the proper prefix of any string in } A}
$$

We show that if $$A$$ is regular, $$NE(A)$$ is also regular.

---

Let $$M_A = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_{0A}, F_A)$$ be a DFA that accepts $$A$$.
We construct a machine $$M_N$$ that accepts $$NE(A)$$.



$$M_N$$ will be identical to $$M_A$$ except for the final states, so let $$M_N = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_{0A}, F_N)$$.
Define the final states of $$M_N$$:

$$
F_N = \setbuilder{q \in F_A}{\hat{\delta}_A(q, x) \not\in F_A \text{ for any } x}
$$

So, $$M_N$$ is simply a machine that accepts strings that end up in a final state for which there is no additional path to any other final state.
Then $$M_N$$ accepts $$NE(A)$$, and $$NE(A)$$ is regular.
