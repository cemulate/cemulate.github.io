Define operations on languages:

$$

\begin{align*}
& NE(A) = \setbuilder{x}{x \text{ is not the proper prefix of any string in } A} \\
& NP(A) = \setbuilder{x}{x \text{ does not have a proper prefix in } A}
\end{align*}
$$

**(a)** **Theorem**: Context-free languages are not closed under $$NE$$ or $$NP$$.

----

*Proof*:
To construct a counterexample, we must start with some CFL whose whose complement fails to be context-free.
So let $$L = \overline{\setbuilder{a^n b^n c^n}{n \geq 0}}$$.
We showed $$L$$ was context-free in the past, and of course its complement is not.



Now, introduce a new unique alphabet symbol $$ \$ $$ and construct the following new languages:
$$
A = L \$\$ \cup \Sigma^* \$ \qquad B = L \$ \cup \Sigma^* \$ \$
$$

So $$A$$ includes everything in $$\Sigma^*$$ appended with a $$ \$ $$, but also includes copies of the members of $$L$$ decorated with an extra $$ \$ $$.
Similarly, $$B$$ includes every string in $$\Sigma^*$$ appended with two $$ \$ $$'s, but also includes copies of the members of $$L$$ with one less $$ \$ $$.


These languages are context-free.
We can see this by machine construction.
Start with a PDA $$M$$ for $$L$$ (that accepts by final state).
To construct a machine for $$A$$, add an $$\epsilon$$ transition from *every* state of $$M$$ to a state that waits for 1 $$ \$ $$ before accepting, and add an $$\epsilon$$ transition from the *final* states of $$M$$ to a state that waits for 2 $$ \$ $$'s before accepting.
Similarly, do the opposite to construct a machine for $$B$$.



Now consider $$NE(A)$$.
A string $$ x \$ $$ in $$A$$ has no extensions in $$A$$ if and only if $$x$$ is *not* in $$L$$ (otherwise, we could add another $$ \$ $$ to get another string in $$A$$).
That is, we have $$NE(A) = \overline{L} \$ $$.
It follows from the fact that $$\overline{L}$$ is not context-free that this $$NE(A)$$ is not context-free, so $$A$$ is a counterexample for $$NE$$.



Now, consider $$NP(B)$$.
A string $$ x \$\$ $$ in $$B$$ has no prefix in $$A$$ if and only if $$x$$ is *not* in $$L$$ (otherwise, we could remove the last $$ \$ $$ to get another string in $$B$$).
That is, we have $$NP(B) = \overline{L} \$\$ $$, and similarly it follows that this is not context-free, so $$B$$ is a counterexample for $$NP$$.
