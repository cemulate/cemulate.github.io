**Theorem**: If a grammar $$G$$ is in Chomsky normal form, for any string $$w \in L(G)$$ of length $$n$$ with $$n \geq 1$$, any derivation of $$w$$ has $$2n-1$$ steps.

----

*Proof*:
Let $$w \in L(G)$$ with $$|w| = n$$.
To generate $$w$$, we must first generate a string with exactly $$n$$ variables, since terminals are only introduced as the replacement of exactly one variable.
A string with $$n$$ variables must be generated through a derivation of $$n-1$$ steps.
To see this, note that the start variable is a string containing one variable, and one derivation step always replaces one variable with exactly two variables, that is, increases the amount of variables by 1.
So After $$n-1$$ derivations, we will have a string with $$1 + (n-1) = n$$ variables.
After generating the string of $$n$$ variables, we must replace each variable with a terminal, which requires $$n$$ more derivations.
So a derivation of $$w$$ requires $$(n-1) + n = 2n -1$$ steps.
