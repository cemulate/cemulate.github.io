This is a collection of solutions to a selection of the textbook problems I've written up over the years, organized by textbook.
If you happen to find an error, typo, or any other kind of problem, feel free to [open a Github issue at this site's repository](https://github.com/cemulate/cemulate.github.io), or just send me an email.

#### [***Algebraic Topology*** **(Hatcher)**](/math_solutions/hatcher/index)

Mostly from Chapter 2 and 3 -- covering homology theory and a bit of cohomology theory.

---

#### [***Algebraic Topology: An Introduction*** **(Massey)**](/math_solutions/massey/index)

Solutions mostly covering the fundamental group and covering space theory.

---

#### [***Theory of Computation*** **(Sipser)**](/math_solutions/sipser/index)

Solutions are mostly from chapter 1 and 2, covering automata and regular/context-free languages.

#### [***Basic Category Theory*** **(Leinster)**](/math_solutions/leinster/index)
